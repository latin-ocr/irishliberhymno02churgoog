TIIE Hl'MN OF ST. COLMAN MAG MURCHON. xv

B. Line-rhymes.

Ba The first to be considered is St. Colman Mac Murchon's
hymn in praise ol St. Michael (our Nu. 8). The metre is, as in
St. Sechnall's hymn, 2(8÷7); but the new feature is unmistake·
able. The rlcyme is thoroughly lrish rhyme, and all the stanzas
are perfect in this respect.

Rich trisyllabic rhymes occur throughout as follows: onu'ne,
nonnae ,· doctore, corpore ,· incrgiae, superbiae ,· arclmngyli, augeli,-
spccies‚ requies,· probabilis, fragilis ,· uiribus, rm‘libus ,- uultu,
gaudia,· filio, consilto. The sull rhyming accent is, ol course,
on the antepenult; but all the three vowels are in exact
correspondence, as are also the consonants which separate
them. Thus in doctore, corpore, the group os consonants ct
corresponds to η), just as in ll. ιι, 12, noctibus, sortibus,
ct corresponds to rt.

ln the last stanza but one, the poet seems to have been
inspired to a final effort os technical skill, which it will not be
easy to parallel sor the richness ol its rhymes assonances,
alliterations and harmonies :—

aetema possint praestare regis regni aulia
ut possideam cum Christo paradisi gaudia.

Here note (ι), the rich trisyllabic rhymes; (2), the two
p-alliterations in each line; (3), the harmonies regis regni, and
(4), the correspondences possint, posscdeam, as also prestare and
Cltristo.

The poet was obviously quite conscious os his aim and os its
success: he immediately adds his Gloria Patri, which in this
case is quite in harmony with the metre, and may probably be
genuine. The subsequent lines adiuuet nos, dac, have nothing to
do with the Hymn itself‚ but are merely a later addition sor
liturgical purposes.

lt is astonishing how little ol the technical structure ol this
poem seems to have been perceived by those who have handled
