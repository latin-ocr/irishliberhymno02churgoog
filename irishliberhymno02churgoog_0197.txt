GLORIA IN EXCELSIS. 137

In l. 9 the words et omues dicimus omcu may have come from a
marginal rubric which found its way into the text at an early date.
Another illustration is aflorded hythe last words of Ps, cti. “let all
the people say, Amen‚” which is probably in like manner a rubrical
direction that has got into the text of the Hebrew Psalter. But
Mr. ll’arren makes the interesting observation that a similar clause
is also inserted in the Armenian office for l'espers in the text of the
hymn φῶο ἱλαρὸν ἁγίας ciffus. And Mr. Macgregor has suggested that
ct omncs dicimus, Amen is an importation of the phrase “And say we,
Amen,” which is found in parts of the Jewish Moming Service.¹

It m'll be obserwed that neither in the text of B, which (as we hase-
said) is not distinctively Celtic, nor in that of S, where the Gloria iu
excelsis is found in its place in the Eucharistic senice, are there any
supplementary anthems like those found in T, F, and sk The rari-
ation in these is a phenomenon which presents itself again in con-
nexion with the texts of the Te Deum ,· and it will be seen that some
of those with which we are familiar in the Te Deum are found in
these Irish manuscripts as addenda to the Gloria iu ascelsis. Tor
instance Dignam domiue iiocte isla [die islo] siue peccalo uos cicslodire
(ll. τι, 22) is in the ordinary texts of the Te Deum ,· it was among the
Preces used at Prime and was there followed by Pss. cxxii. 3, and cxxxii.
aa. Dr. Gibson, in the article to which we hare already referred,
suggests that these antiphons, which were originally attached to the
Gloria iu excelsis, became linked with the Te Deum when this began
to take the place of the older hymn in the daily offices of the Church.²

Neither the lrish Prefaccs to the Magnifica! and Benedictus nor
the glosses seem to call for any special remark. 'l'he majority of the
glosses in T to both of these canticles are taken, as the references we
have added show, from Bule’s Commentary on St. Luke. They
constituted the stock intrude of most commentators of the period,
andare found eg. also in Hraban Maur's Commentario iu Cuuu'co
quae ad laudes dicamur. Whether or not they were original with Bede
is another question into which we do not here inquire. Bede is often
explicitly quoted by lrish writers; the index to our first volume shows
how well he was known to our scholiasts.

ΊἸιθ text of these Canticles, especially of the Benedictus, is interesting
in connexion with the question as to the version of the latin New
Testament current in the Celtic Church. which was—speaking genemlly
-k'ulgate with considerable traces of the ‘European’ Old latin out of
which it grew. ‘Ab aeuo' in l. 6 is, for instance, quite characteristic

The marginal note on fol. ro of Τ is made up, for the most part,¹
of extracts from the Pastorul Rule of Gregory the (lreat. This was-
