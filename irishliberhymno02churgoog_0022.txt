THE LORICA OF GILDAS. Α xxi

iacula, not Jizcula, is very noteworthy, as it is quite foreign to the
general usage, by which initial i before a vowel is consonantal;
cs. jacula in Altus Prosator, l. 96. As usual ii is a monoph-
thong; eg. euangelf( ).

The verse 45, 46 though ending with alleluia, like the
preceding stanzas, has nothing to do with the poem, as the
measure is totally different

Τ lte lorica of Gildas.

Bd. We have now to consider the Lorica of Gildas (Νο. 48),
which is most instmctive in respect of the treatment of Latin
words by this class of writers. As in the other Latin hymns of
this lrish family, no elision is observed, and quantity is often
ignored; the whole attention is concentrated on the number of
syllables, and on the rhyme correspondences. The metre is
trochaic trimeter catalectic, and the formula is 2(6 -1- 5). ln
every pair of lines there is a cretic jingle of assonance (tri-
syllabic).

The last three syllables exhibit these following principles :-

(1) The last vowel always rhymes exactly, and a succeed-
ing consonant, if present, is always the same ; thus we
have as the rhyming finals, a, e, i, 0,· as, es, is, us ,· am,
em, um,· at.

(2) This final vowel may be preceded immediately, (a) by
another rhyming vowel, or (b) be separated from it by
a single consonant, b, c, t,· l, m, n, r, or in four cases
by the combined consonants 8311, 23 mn, 45 rm, 85
nt.

ln case of (a) we have the combinations, i·a, i·am,
i·as, i·at,· i·e, i·cs,· but i·am rhymes with e·am, i-at
with e-at, i·a with e·la and u·a‚ and i·as with umas.

ln case of (b), we have the liquids ‘rhyming’ with
each other: m, r,· n, r,· n, l,· but we have l rhyming
with c and with t,· r with c .· in other words, the single
consonants that are used as ‘intervenere' were appa.
