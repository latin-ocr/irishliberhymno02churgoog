PREFACE TO ST. SANCTAN'S H YMN. 47·

Parnaco ro Sr. Sawcraw’s Hvuu.

TF] ‘I beseech a wonderful king! Bishop Sanctan com-
posed this hymn, and it was on his going to Clonard west-
ward to inis Matoc that he composed it; he was brother to
Matoc, both of them being ol British race, but Matoc came
into lreland earlier quam Bishop Sanctan. Causa autam haec
cst, to free it ab hastthus, and that his brother should be
allowed (to come) to him in insulam ,· Scoticam uera linguam
usquead haram lranc nan habuit sed deus ei tam cita cam
donauit. Tempus autem dubitatur.

TF] 1 beseech a wonderful King os angela,
for it is a name that is mightiest;

to me (be) God for my rear, God on my lest,

God ior my van, God on my right!

5 God sor my help,—holy call-
against each danger, Him l invoke!
a bridge os lise let there be below me,
benediction oi God the Father above me!

Let the losty Trinity arouse us,
10 (each one) to whom a good death (l) is not (yet) certaIn!
Holy Spirit noble, strength os heaven,
God the Father, Mary's migbty Son!

A great King who knows our offences
lord over earth, without sin,-
15 to my soul for every black-sin
let never demons' godlessness (Ρ) visit me!

God with me, may He take away each toil!
may Christ draw up my pleadings‚
may apostles come all around me,
20 may the Trinity ol witness come to me!
