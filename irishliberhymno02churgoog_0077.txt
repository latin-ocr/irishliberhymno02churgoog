PREFACE TO THE H l'MN OF ST. COLMAN. 13

T] pestilence, so that there might be nine waves between them
and land, sor pestilence does not come across beyond (that
distance), utsemnt periti. And a certain person os Colman’s

school asked, “What was the blessing, in which going on a
journey befel them Ρ ” Then spake Colman, “What blessing
is that?’' said he, “ why, what but God’s blessing?” For
this is what they sought aster, to go t'orth on islands os the
sea on flight before the disease.

F] composed this hymn against that pestilence, and he chanced to be
composing it just when he began a J'oumey to a certain island in
the sea, that there might be nine waves between them and land, sor
pestilence does not come over nine waves, utsemnt periti. Anda
certain person ol his school asked Colman, “ What was the blessing,

in which going on a joumey befel them?” Then spake Colman,
“ What blessing is that?” said he, “why, what but God’s blessing ?'’
