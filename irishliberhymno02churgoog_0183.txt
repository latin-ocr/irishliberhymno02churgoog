THE Hl'MN OF ST. CUCHUIMNE. 123

Phaeaca ro rua livurv or Sr. Cucuuruua

Of Cuchuimne, to whom the authorship of the hymn is ascribed in
the Prefaces in T and F, we know but little. According to the Annuls
of Ulster he died in the year 7463 and heis commemorated on Oct. 7
in the Martyrology of German. The name means ‘⁶ hound of memory “’;
it is perhaps not unnecessary to observe that bound was atitle of respect
among the Irish.¹

An ingenious identification of Cuchuimne with Cummean, to whom
the Irish penitential literature of the middle ages is so much indebted,
was suggested jointly by Dr. Wh. Stokes and Mr. Henry Bradshaw in
the year 1885. At the end of one of the Paris MSS. of the Irish
collection of canons known as the Hibernensis, Mr. Bradshaw· read
the rubric: Hucusque uubeu (a cucur'mr'uua ἐν du riuis. It seems
not impossible that Cucluu'mue abbas ex Durrur's may be concealed
under the last words of this; and it is curious that the entry in the
Annals of the Four Masters preceding that which relates to Cuchuimne
records the obit of an abbot of Darinis, an island near Youghal upon
which there wasa monastic establishment. This identification, however,
though not improbable in itself, must not be considered as established.
It has been usual, though in like ‘manner without sufficient proof, to
equate Cummean the author of the l’em'uuuule to St. Cummain the
Fair, the seventh abbot of Iona, large portioris of whose life of St.
Columba were incorporated by adamnan into his more elaborate
worlc

King Loingsech, in whose time the hymn is said to have been
written, reigned (according to O’Flaherty's Chronology) from 695 to
704.

The legend in the Preface would seem to indicate that the first half
of Cuchuimne’s life having been devoted to the study of literature, the
second half was spent in profligacy. The obscure verses which tell of
this are also found in the margin of the Dublin copy of the Annals of
Ulster at the year 74⁶· where they are attributed, not to Adamnan‚ but
to the Nurse of Cuchuimne. They are quoted, probably from the
Annals of Ulster, by theFour Masters, and are also found in the margin
of the Book of Fenagh (fol. 8).

Several points call for comment in these verses. Todd observes
that in such a record of the weakness of Cuchuimne there is great
internal evidence of truth. Co dmimne, ‘to the ridge’ plainly means
‘half-way'; [compare the Auru ll. 283, 286], but the phrase is a
curious one. The play upon wordS, ruleg ‘he read’ in l. ro and
ruleic ‘he left' in 1. 12 will be observed.

rigam, it is impossible to determine the exact meaning in l. 12 of the
word chailleclra, which means either ‘nuns' or ‘old women! Neither
term is in keeping with the plain drift of the lines, as referred to in 1. 5 ;
so that probably O’Donovan's translation ‘hags’ is the least offensive.

In l. 18 it is not at all easy to say what araid cu'i means: cu‘i rhymes
