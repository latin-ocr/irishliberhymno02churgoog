A critical examination ol this poem will show that, whatever truth
there may be in the account ol its composition given in the Prelace, it

is not the whole tmth. An important article by M. Gaidoz on this
hymn appeared in vol. v ol the Revue Celticae (p. 94), in which it was
pointed out that it falls into three natural divisions.

1. The first division (verses 1-38) is plainly the original poem, and
it ends, as is the practice of Irish hymnologists, with the words Se'n
De‘ dowjesordonve with which it began. This part oi the piece consists
oi a number of invocations of saints, chiefly Old Testament personage&
and from the fragments of Latin phrases which occur here and there at
the end ol lines, it is natural to suspect that it maybe based ona Latin
original. This suspicion becomes almost a certainty when we lind many
ol the same saints described in the same way, invoked in the familiar
Commendatio animae quando infirmus est in extremis, ol the Breviary. A
few lines oi this may be transcribed.

‘⁴ Libeia, domine, animam eius, sicut liberasti Enoch et Eliam de
communi morte mundi . . . Noe de diluuio . . . Abraham de Ur
Chaldaeomm lob de passionibus eius . . . . Isaac de hostia etde
manu patrissui Abrahae . . . lot de Sodomis et de flamma ignis
. . . Moysen de manu Pharaonis regis AEgyptiomm . . . .
Danielem de lacu leonum . . . tres pueros de camino ignis ardentis
et demanu regis iniqui . . Susannam de salso crimine . . . David
de manu regis Saul et de manu Goliae . . . Petrum et Paulum de
carceribus . . . Theclam uirginem et martyrem tuam de atrocissi-
mis tormentis . . .

sic liberare digneris animam huius serui tui et tecum facias in bonis
congaudere caelestibus.''

An lrish Litany presenting striking resemblances to this first division
ol our hymn is also found at the end ol the Felircof Oengus‚ lrorn which
we quote some stanzas :¹

‘¹ Deliver me, Ο Jesu, O lord oi fair assembties, as Thou deliveredst
Elijah‚ with Enoch, from the world.

Deliver me,0 Jesu, from every ill on earth, as Thou deliveredst Noah,
son os lamech, from the flood.

Deliver me, Ο Jesu, O King of pure brightness as Thou deliveredst
Abraham from the haud os the Chaldeans.

Deliver me, Ο Jesu, O King mysterious, gracious, as Thou deliveredst
Lot from thesin os the cities¹

Deliver me, Ο jesu, Ο King high, wonderful, as Thou deliveredst
Jonah from the belly ceti magni.

Deliver me, Ο Jesu, in Thy many-graced kingdom, as Thou deliveredst
Isaac from his lather’s hands.
