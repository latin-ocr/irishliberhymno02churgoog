PREFACE TO THE H l'MN OF ST. CUCHUIMNE. 17

Phaeaca το Tha thim oa Sa. Cucauilma.

TF] Cantemus iu omni die : Cuchuimne fecit lma
hymnum to praise the Virgin Mary; and in the time oi
Loingsech mac Oengusaand os Adamnan sactusest,· incertum
est uero in quo loco eum fecit. The cause os its composition
was to free him from the evil lise in which he lived, quia can-
iugem ltabuit et iu inula uita cum illa fuit.

Or maybe it was to get made smooth before him the part
oi his reading he had not yet attained to, that he made this
eulogy sor Mary. lu Mantuanus dixit :

Cuchuimne

‚ read science up to [the] ridge ;
the other half that is over
he lest sor his hags.

Cuchuimne deluit:

Cuchuimne

read science up to [the] ridge;

the other hals that is over

he will read, he will leave [his] haga.

the other hals os his allotted path (Ρ)
he will read all, till he become a sage.

ln rhythm now he made it ; and fourteen capitula therein,
pith two lines in each capitulum and twelve syllables in each
me.
