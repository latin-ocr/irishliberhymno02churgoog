THE mam ALTUS PROSATOR. 151

From the summit ol heaven’s kingdom, from the brightness of
angelic station,
15 from the beauty os the splendour ol his form,
through pride Lucifer, whom He had made, had fallen3
and the apostate angels too by the same sad sall
of the author os vainglory and stubborn envy,
the rest remaining in their principalities.

20 The Diagon, great, most foul, terrible, and old,
which was the slimy serpent, more subtle than all the beasts
and hercer living things of earth,
drew with him the third part of the stars into the abyss
ol the infernal regions and ol divers prisons,
2 5 apostate from the True Light‚ headlong cast by the parasite.

The Most High, soreseeing the lrame and order ol the world
· had made the heaven and earth. The sea and waters He

established ;
likewise the blades ol gloss, the twigs ol shrubs3
sun, moon, and stars; lire and necessary things ;
30 birds, lish, and cattle ; beasts and living things:
and lastly man first-formed to rule with prophecy.

So soon as the stam, the lights ol the finnament, were made,
the angels praised for His wondrous handywork
the Lord of the vast mass, the Builder of the heavens,
3 5 with praise giving proclamation‚ meet and unceasing;
and in noble concert gave thanks to the lord,
os love and choice, not stom endowment os nature.

Our first two parents having been assailed and seduced‚
the Devil falls a second time, with his satellites ;
40 by the honoros whose laces and the sound ol whose llight
lrail men, strichen with sear, should be aflrighted
being unable with carnal eyes to look upon them;
who now are bound in bundles with the bonds of their prison·
houses.

He, removed from the midst, was cast down by the bord.
45 The space ol the air is closely crowded

with a disordered crew of his rebel satellites; invisible,

lest men insected by their evil examples and their crimeS,

no screens or walls ever hiding thern,

should openly defile themselves before the eyes ol all.

50 The clouds carry the wintry floods from the sountains ol the sea—
the three deeper floods ol Ocean—
to the regions ol heaven in azure whirlwinds,
to bless the crops, the vineyards and the buds;
driven by the winds issuing from their treasure houses,
55 which drain the corresponding shallows os the sea
