THE H ΥΜΝ OF ST. PHILIP.

Tire Hrrrn' or Sr. Prrrrrr‘.

Philip apostle, apostle holy;

at a fair, Philip told

(oi) the immortal birds, slender,
that dwelt in lnis Eidheand.

ln the East os Africa they abide3

it is a pleasant labour they persorm;
there never came into the world

any colour that was not on their wings.

Their plumage remains on them
from the lawiul beginning os the world,

' without deficiency oi one bird oi them,

without increase to them in their numbers,

Seven sair rivers in all their length
are in the plains where they dwell;
it is this that ieeds them sor ever,
and they sing songs with saireustom.

They allotted as share the middle of the night,
being on horses ior ever,

to the drone os the angels as they speed

in the air overhead.

The first birds sing pleasantly‚
-it is not unfitting their being very melodious—

all the wondrous courses
that God wrought before the world.

A crowd os them sing aster rising
at the time of nocturns,

what God will do, excellent matter.
from earth’s beginning till Doom.

The birds whose wishes are good sing

in the twilight with its swift-moving looks
what God will do of wonders beyond

in tbe Day oi the Judgement os the Racings.
