THE H l'MN SEN DE.

oi: 11 Moisi; 31 'roigse3 34 doroiter; 37 mdir.

ua: puas(erl; ro uasal ; 20 huan ; 29 ruadi.

ui: 3 suide3 4 ruire; 11 tuisech3 15 adsluinnem; 39 guidi ; 41 huili;
50 huile.

There is one example os the union os three vowels, in the
interpolated lines, 40, timchuairt, but it is also monophthong.
Thus, whatever vowels come together they are pronounced
together. To this the only exceptions are in the proper names
l'ob, Not', and Eone, as dissyllables.

On examining the poem, it appears that all the half lines
contain seven syllables, with these exceptions :-

16 Iesu con apstalaib (ST, but F has cona).
2 5 qui per soecula liabetur (but here soecla must be read).
lt seems therefore that the writer intended that his poem
should l'ollow these laws :-

1. Each stanza to consist os two lines rhyming dissylla-
bically'.

2. Each line to have a caesura aster the seventh syllable and
to end with the lourteenth.

3. All vowels coming together in the same word to be
pronounced in one syllable, but not so when coming
together in separate words.¹

4 With the exception os the last ictus on the penultimate
syllable os the line, the place os the ictus was not
fixed, but the number os syllables in the line naturally
limited the number ol beats, to tow or llerec in each

hall-line.

The law ol the stanza may be exhibited, thus :-

first hals-line Second hals-line
two or three bears ' two or three beats
