80 AMRA OF ST. COLUMBA.

T] May it be smooth abodedarkness srom me

i.e. may it be easy for me to go past the black abodeS, ubi
sunt demones. Or, ‘mendum’ i.e. lie. and ‘menna' means
lies: may he expel from me the black lies·

675 May the descendant os the body os Cathair with
nobility see me without stain.

i.e. may he look on me without stain, a descendant of
Cairpre Nia-fer os Leinster; sor Ethne daughter os Dimma
mac Noe was his (Colum Cille's) mother, of the Carburys
os Leinster; and he (Cairpre) nas a descendant os Cathair
Mor, son os Feidliruid the All-wise.

680 Ghreat re-declension; great of the poem, os heaven,
eavea-sun.

i.e. great is the re-sorming I have put on the above words;
great is the ‘nath’ the poets used to make in the beginning
sor sun and moon ; and not gre-ater is the darkening they used
to put on them, as 1 have put. Or, though great they deemed
the excelleney of sun and moon, not greater do we deeur it
than the excellency of the death os Colum Cille. uidam huan

. . i.e. quia amatus sum derum.
