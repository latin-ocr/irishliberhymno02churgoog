his [Church] the gates oi hell do not prerail.'' 'she B glossator seems
to take u! Petrus with fide r'mmobilr's, in this way.

The gloss in B, “ Petrus agnoscens ’', agrees as do many like glosses
in the text, with the explanation furnished in Jerome's Dc nominibus
Hebraicis. St. Jerome uas widely read in Ireland3 his works were con·
suited, ior instance. by Oengus the Culdee, and he is quoted frequently
and with respect in Irish books and by Irish writers. Columbauus in
his letter to Gregory the Great goes so iar as to say that theman who
contradicts the authority oi Jerome will be looked on as a heretie, and
rejected with scorn hythe Churchesol the West. His Irish name was
Citius.

The interpretation ol th. xri. 18 suggested in the gloss is the
usual interpretation with Irish writers.¹ Α remarkable paraphrase oi
the verse occurs in avernacular T ract on the Liturgy in the Lcubliur
Brcuc': “that is upon the firmness ol the laith os the first martyrs who
were laid in the foundation ol the building and ol the last martyrs up
te Eliiah and Enoch.'’

notes in the Book os Armaglz (iol. 2): “dicens ei adesse tempus ut
ueniret et aeuangelico rete nationes ieras et barbaras ad quas docendas
misserat illum deus ut piscaret.'' 'she metaphor ultimately rests, ol
course, on hlt. iv. 19. ln St. Patrick’s Confessio this last verse is quoted,
with the comment: “ L'nde autem ualde oportebat retia nostra tendere,
ita ut multitudo copiosa et turba Deo caperetur‚'’ &e
