THE H Yam ΝΟΜ PATER. 171

In the commentary on the Amra (l. 367) it is said of Columba that he
was a student of the writings of Cassian. But although this may well
be believed, there is no notice of the¹ observance of ten Canonical
Hours in Cassian’s Institutes; our reference is to a passage in which
he speaks of the use of services at seven fixed hours and refers to
Pa cxviii. 164. Mr. Macgregor (Early Scolfr'slr Worslzip, p. 12)

thinks that “the discrepancy may be reconciled by adding Compline

We have here the story of the founding of the Church of Derry by
Columba. It may be read elsewhere eg. in O‘Donnell's Life of Columba
(see vol. i. p. xix), or in the Leablrar Breac (fol. 32al‚ or in the Book of
Lismore (ed. Stokes, cf. 174; cf. also p. 305), but our Prefaces fumish
the oldest extant authorities for the legend Aed mac Ainmerech‚
according to the Irish Annals died in 598 or 5993 but it appears that
the grant of territory to Columba must have been made in his name
when he was quite a lad, as the foundation of Derry is set down at the
year 545. Of Mobi the Flat—faced‚ who was the instructor of Columba
at the monastery of Glasnevin, we shall hear again, as his genealogy is
registered in the T copy of the Liber Hymnornm. The obscure quatrain
about Mobi's girdle is found in the Book of Lismore (ed. stokes p. 26),
and it is quoted in the Martyrology of Donegal at Octr. 12.

The tradition that connects the hymn with St. Columba is pretty
constant, and the style of the piece is not altogether dissimilar to that
of his more famous Altus. The abrupt way in which one subject after
another is introduced will be observed and the harshness of the Latin
is also remarkable. We have found it in two MSS. (Ο and Q) of
O'Donnell's Life of Columba, from the latter of which a portion of it
was printed by Colgan‚ who also printed the l· text (Tn‘as, pp. 397,
476). An English translation is given by Mr. Macgregor in his
St. Columba.

Tbere are two Irish glosses in T of which we give the translation at
this point:

2 un'dine] ile. by Fire ,· or ly l'ellmo Plagae.

5 exultent] ile. they· reyirice ‚· the right reading is probably exaltent.

uagi also seems to be wrong ; uaga would give good sense, and we

The story that the hymn was miraculously composed by Columba to
check the progress of a lire may be dismissed without commem3 and there
is nothing to commend the scholiast's second theory that it was written
in view of the Day of Judgement. But his third explanation that it was
‘the Fire of St. John’s Feast’ that the writer had in his mind is very
