THE H YMN SEN DE. xxxix

Aaron, Dauni, Job, the prophets‚ the Maccabeos, John the
Baptist. JesuS, the Apostles, Mary, Joseph, Stephen, lgnatius‚
martyrs, hermits and virgins.¹ ‘lhen in ll. 21-38 we begin
again, with Noalt, Melchisedech, Lot„ Abraham, the Three
Children, David, Daniel, Peter, Jonah, the italicised names being
common to both series.

This repetition plainly denotes the use of an additional
document, from which the writer was making excerpts. ln this
case the addition was characterised by the quite peculiar intro·
duction ol Latin rhyming lines or hals-lines, as shown here :—

21 regem regum rogamus in nostris sermonibus
.. diluui temporibus.
2 3 Melchisedech rex Salem incerto de semine
24 ab omni formidine.

.. .. .. qui per secla habetur
2 ur nos omnes precamur liberare dignetur.
limpa fontis in gaba
Dauid de manu Golai.
ulli leonum ori.
nostro opere digno
in paradisi regno.

The last stanza os the second section (ll. 37, 38), has plainly
been added to round off the piece. sonuli does not come
naturally into the series aster Peter. When the writer had got
as sar as 1. 36, where the (assumed) Latin original probably
ended with in paradisi regno, he too sought to bring his worlr
to an end, and so the repetition ol Sen dd donse sordente
demanding a monosyllable to rhyme with te, the familiar stop-
gap nronar nglc was suggested, and Jonah and his whale suited ·
this well enough.

ln the lines next following, the metre is differeht, for lines
39, 40 make a stanza with rhyming trisyllables at the end,
pride-sc, seule-se, while lines 41-43 have a wholly incongruous

¹ The whole Litany may be compared with the litany given in Sallair na Rann
(poem cxxxviii p 107, l. 7297 e), which follows a similar Biblr'cal list, though
Srokes has obscured this by not perceiving that Orth mentioned in ir is not the
Odyssean οὔτις, but ΕΜ.
