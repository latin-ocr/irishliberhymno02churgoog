THE waw oa sr. mcc. 33

TF] The tribes of lreland prophesied that to thern would come

a new Prince of peace;
20 His succession will remain till the day os Judgement, empty
would be the land os T ara, silent!

His druids from Loegaire hid not Patrick’s coming;
Tirszglggphecy was sulfilled os the kingdom of which they

Patriok was illustrious till he died, powerful was his expulsion
Thii iiidsliilhhi raised his goodness upwards from him beyond
dwellings os mankind.

25 Hymns and Apocalypse, the Three Fifties, he used to sing
Hihfiiiila'ched baptized‚ prayed; from God's praise he ceased
no .

Cold os weather did not keep him srom sleeping at night
Inffiilifflh’he won his Kingdom‚—by day he preached on
1 s.

ln (sountain) Slan‚ to the north of Benn-Boirche,—neither
drought nor flood took it,-
30 He sings one hundred psalms each night to an angels’ King
whom he served.

He sleegislrlan a bare stone thereaster, with a damp mantle
aroun rm;

His piilcl>¹w was a pillar-stone; he lest not his body in
warmt .

He preached the Gospel to everyone, he wrought mighty
miracles widely:
He heals lame and lepers; dead-solli, he raised them to lise.

35 Patrick preached to the ScotS, he suffered great labour
Thhidgihund him they may come to Judgement, everyone
whom he brought to lise.

Sons os Emer, sons of Herimon, went all with the devii ;
The Transgressor flung them into the deep vast pit.
