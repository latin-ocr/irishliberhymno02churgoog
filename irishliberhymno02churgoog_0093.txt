PREFACE TO THE HYMN OF ST. FIACC. 31

, Pnnrncu ro rna Hrun on Sr. Frncc.

TF] ‘Patrick was born! Fiacc of Sletty composed this
hymn about Patrick. Now this Fiacc was son of Mac Erca‚
son of Bregan, son of Daire Barrach,—fr0m whom are
the Hy·Barrchi,—son of Cathair Mdr3 and the said Fiacc
was further a pupil of Dubthach mac Ui Lugair‚ who was
high poet of lreland. In the time of Loegaire mac Neill it
was composed. It was this Dubthach who rose up before
Patrick at Tara, after Loegaire had decreed that none should
rise up before him in the house ; and he became a friend of
Patrick from thenceforth, and was afterwards baptized by
Patrick. Well, he went on one occasion to Dubthach’s house
in Leinster. and Dubthach gave great welcome to Patriclr.
Said Patrick to Dubthach, ‘¹ Seelr out for me a man of rank,
of good family and morals, who has tantum one wife and
one son.” “Why dost thou seek that, ir. a man of that
stamp?'' said Dubthach. “For him to enter into orders.''
“Fiacc is the man,'’ said Dubthach, “but he has gone on
circuit in Connaught.'’ While they were engaged over these
words, just then carne Fiacc on visit with him. Said
Dubthach, “Here is the person we spoke of.” “Though he
be so,” said Patriclr, “possibly quod diximus would not be
agreeable to him.'' “Let there be made an attempt at
tonsuring me,” said Dubthach, “so that Fiacc may see it.’'
So when F iacc saw it: he asked, “Why is an attempt being
made to tonsure Dubthach?” said (he). “ That is wasteful,”
said he, “for there is not in lreland a poet the like of him.''
“Thou wouldst betaken in place of him,” said Patriclr. “The
loss of me from lreland is less than (would be the loss of)
Dubthach‚'’ said Fiacc. So Patriclc cut off Fiacc's beard
tunc, and there came great grace upon him thereafter, so that
he read all the ecclesiastical order in one night, uel quindecim
diebus ut alii serunt, and there was conferred upon him
bishop’s grado, so that it is he who is the chief bishop os
[einster from thenceforth, and his coarb after him. The
place of it is Duma Gobla, north-west of Sletty ; tempus, of
Lugaid mac Loegaire, for he was King of lreland tunc,¹ but
the causa waS, to praise Patriclr, and it was composed afterhis
death, urserunt quidam.
