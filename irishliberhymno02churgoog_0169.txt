ol these words is necessary lor the metre. llut this is not accurate,
and there is no good reason sor such repetition here.

l. ao. Engaaacld as Loclr [τίη] So the Martyrolagy as German at
Nor. 12. Loch Lein is the principal lake ol Killarney. Eagaaacld was
the tribe name os the descendants os Eogan Mor, king ol Munster in
the second century.

l. 35. upon thee. O blachia, dvc] 'l'hese words are a gloss although
the copyist of the Presace does not seem to have understood them so.
The omission in T of the initial F in l‘iachna, as, a little lower down,
ol the initial letter ol Flann, is very common with lrish scribes

l. 47. sard friend] arandam-a, the ordinary Irish word lor a confessor,
or spiritual director.

l. 48. Colama'lla] St. Columba died in 597, so that the chronology
seems confused. It is possible, however, that when Columcille is
mentioned, it is his coam or successor that is meant, who inherited his
privileges and was regarded as speaking in his name.

l. 47. earnaard] r'a'. to lona, the seat os St. Columba's samous monas-
tery. ln the quatrain ascribed to Columba. there is a play on the word
stammam, which means ‘communion'

l. 61. Domaad refuses a, &cl 'l'hese verses, 'l'odd says, “seem
to allude to the ancient custom ol putting on the raiment os the saint
who acted as your penitentiary, in token of submission and humiliation.

the lines are not grammatically explicable ; aa gab ought to mean ‘do

1 'l'he opening words of this hymn are, as the Presace observes,
horrowed from Nahum i. ¹5· 'l'he glossator in T who says necessitas
metri pu! licre luda instead as ladea was, seemingly. ignorant os this
reference. F has no glosses on this hymn.

2 The repetition ol alleluia aster each stanza (it is apparently only
through inadvertence that it is omitted alter the tirst stanza in T) is a
deiice which is found in two hymns in the Barrgnrr antiphonaria the
first. “ Precamur patrem,'' being. like that now under consideration, a

hymn in praise os the Apostles. the other a hymn sor Feasts os hlartyrs
beginning “ sacratissimi martyres*
