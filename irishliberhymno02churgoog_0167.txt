THE Ht'um CHRISTUS* IN NOSTRA. 107

manuscript which though now at the Vaticau was originally at Heidel-
berg.

01 the three persons named 111 th'e Prelace as possible authors ol the
piece, a word or two only can be said here.

Ninnid‚ when a young scholar, so say the later lives ol Brigid‚¹ came
under the favourable notice ol the saint, who predicted that she herself,
on the day ol her death, should receive the viaticum at his hands. On
hearing this the youth enclosed his right hand in a loclred case, lest it
should eser be deliled by the touch ol any unclean thing3 and so he
was known as Ninnid ‘ Purehand.’

fiacc ol Sletty we shall meet with again as the reputed author ol a
famous hymn (our No. 19). He died belore Brigid.

Ultan of Ardbreccan 111 the co. hleath the author whose claims
Colgan larours‚ is also named as the composer of the Irish hymn
No. 21 in praise ol St. Brigid. nll that it seems possible to say with
confidence is that the statement in the Prelace‚ that he was one of
St. Brigid’s biographers‚ rests on early tradition. He is reputed to have
died 111. 656, and his name lingers in Irish topography‚ in the 101111
’‘Cahir L'ltan.’' There is a Latin poem in praise ol him, beginning
1111111111, dte„ printed in Diimmler‚ lbet. lat. 11111111111111, 1. p. 589.

Τ he words 11111 11111111 1111111111 in l. 5 ol the F Prelace are rendered
by Colgan 1111111111111111111111 11111111 illistam} but oscordu means ‘renowned'
or‘well-known.‘ See Silvo Gad. 124, 21; MR. 216, 18; 011. Soc.

statement is frequently met with in panegyrics os St. Brigid. The
mediaeval lrish were fond ol tracing parallels between their own saints
and those ol the N.T. and the early Christian centuries 3 but in no case
is this parallelism pushed to such extravagant lengths as in the case
ol St. Brigid. Thus (see p. 39 abore) in hymn No. 11, l. 12, she is
addressed as “hlother os Jesus’'; and again at the beginning of
hymn No 22 (p. 40), she is invoked as “ brigid, mother os my high
lx'ing.''

Dr. Todd² quotes a remarkable office ol St. Brigid. printed as late as
1622, in which a modihed 101111 01 the legend, that she had a strong
personal resemblance to the lthl‚ is reproduced. 'l'his legend is
given by several ol the mediaewal authorities³

lt will be obsersed that the two strongest expressions in the text
os the piece‚ via, in l.8 11111111 11111111111111111111 and in l. 15 Christi
1111111111 sc spopondit are erased in the Vatican manuscript.
