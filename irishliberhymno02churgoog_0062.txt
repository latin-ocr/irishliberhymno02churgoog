lviii 7HE ME Τ RICAL S VS TEMS OF THE IRISH HYMNS.

lt is probably a genuine relic of St. Patrick. Its uncouth-
ness of grammatical forms is in favour ol its antiquity. We
know that Patrick used very strange lrish,-some os which has
been preserved; and the historians who handed down mude-
brotlt (see p. 178 below) as an ejaculation of his would probably
take care to copy as saithluhy as'they could the other curious
Iris'n forms which the saint had consecrated by his use.

T lu Hymn ofMael Isu.

There is nothing to observe on this short poem (No. 29)
save that the quatrains consist os four lines os six syllables,
ending in dissyllables rhyming on the even lines (2 = 4).
