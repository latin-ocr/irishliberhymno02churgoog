THE H ΥΜΝ NI CAR BRIGIT. lv

unintelligible. Then in 1. 181 the reference to the claidib tencd is
very curious, and quite inapplicable to Brigid.

Stanza xlvii (as pointed out above) is in a metre of which
the anomalous stanza x fumishes the only other example in the
poem. lt is impossible to trace any connexion between its first
three lines and the fourth.

The last six stanzas (xlix-liii) are apparently of the nature
of an appendix to the poem ; but it will be observed that while
live of thern exhibit perfect dissyllabic metre (2 = 4), stanza lii
is quite irregular. ln this we have the third and fourth line
rhyming, D! = immam, against all analogy.

In the last stanza we have a line (212) ε

fora fdessam dun dib-linari,
which recalls a similar line in the δέη Dc‘ (l. 2), vin:

for a oessam dun innocltt.

But the number of syllables cannot be made to tally‚ and
Broccan’s l. 212 is obviously wrong. All the lines in the stanza
are made to end in words with long τ’ penult; but it is probable
that Brzgit was meant to rhyme with llm‘b and riclted with dt’clcill,
and in that case we have again a complete change of metre.

The syncretism and composite character of the piece seem to
be established by the foregoing analysis. There is no a priori
impossibility in the hypothesis that a school os writers¹ are
responsible for the construction of the verses, whether as a set
taslr and as a translation of Cogitosus, or whether as a gradual
growth in imitation of other extant poems which followed the
lines of Cogitosus’ narrative. lt is of course impossible to assign
either date place or person ; and it is alike impossible to divide
the verses so as to group together the writers of each, though
the table given above will suggest tentative arrangements.

lf indeed it were a matter of certainty that these verses had ‘

been put together thus as one poem, at a very early date, a fact
of the kind would simply have to be accepted and the result
