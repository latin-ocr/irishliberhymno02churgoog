labie, in which case there would be an additional example os
elision.

We have, therefore, no material in this respect on which to
base a judgement as to the respective dates ol the two poems

On examining the rhymes, it will be perceived that the
verses do not all sollow the same metrical system.

The abnormal stanzas are vii, xxiv, xxvi, xxvii, xxix-xxxi;
and these must now receive special examination as regards their
subject matter.

vii (ll.13,14). This stanza plainly interrupts the course ol
the story. Stanza vi tells os Patrick's education, stanza viii
ol the call srom Fochlad3 how then could stanza vii say, “the
angels were bringing him ” ?¹ And this becomes even more
unmeaning. when l. 14 is considered; lor the visions are ap·
parently seen by Patrick!

xxiv. (ll. 47, 48). Stanza xxiii tells that when Patrick was
sicle he desired to go to Armagh, but an angel cameto meet
him and (stanza xxv) said to him, ‘Dignity to Armagh,’ &e
This is quite consecutive, but stanza xxiv drags in the name
ol Victor and the allusion to the miraculous Bush, and omits
all mention ol the angel‘s orders, “Revertere ad locum unde
uenis,” as given in the original source³ lt almost seems as if
this stanza had been substituted sor an earlier one, which told
what the angel said in lorbidding Patrick to go to Armagh.
Other difficulties which it presents, are the meaning ol dosaitlr,
and os andralasrm and the subject ol adglastar (F adgalastar).
Taking these things in connexion with the unusualness ol the
rhymes,l am led to the conclusion that the stanza has been
interpolated.

¹ Apparently dedseris is to be used in the same sense as dowyc, ⁴ lllay He bring
us.

originel poem hed really hod Muirchu’s notes before him, hc could not have inserted
this item so baldly.
