St. Columba and St Comgall ol Bangor3 and that ol Cuil Feda near
Clonard in 587.ι

The other story describes the hymn as an extemporaneous utterance,
miraculously composed during the grinding ol a sack os oats.² The
hymn Adiutor laborantium which he is said to have composed on the
way to the mill does not seem to be extant ; it is just possible that there
may be here an allusion to the hymn Iu tc Christe (vol. i. p. 84), the
third line ol which is Deus iu adiutonum intende laborantium.

The mention of the stone, variously called Blathnat or lloel-blatha,
on which “there is made division in the relectory,’' and of which it is
further said that “luck was lelt on all sood that is put thereon,'' is
interesting. 1t is probable that the allusion is to the practice os cutting
up the eulogiae or pain be'uit at a table in the relectory‚ which we know
to have obtained at Iona and also at St. Kenneth's monastery at Aghaboe
in the diocese of Ossory.⁸ Dr. Skene considered that he had identified
this very stone among the ruins at lona⁴

lt will be observed that the statement ol the TF scholiast as to the
donation os lona to Columba conhrms that of Bede‚ in the assertion that
Bntide mac Maelcon‚ king ol the Picts, immolauit Columbo Hi,· it.
obtulit inperpetuum Columbae Iouam.³ T ighemach‚and also the Annals
ol Ulster, represent the island as given by Conall‚ the king ol British
Dalriata Reeves sums up the history thus: “Columba probably sound
Hy uuoccupied and unclaimed, Conall kindly promised not to disturb
him, and when the Picts were converted‚ Brudeus‚ the supreme lord, of
course gave to the infant institution all the right and title which the
weight ol his sanction could conser.’'

'Ihe legend goes on to the effect that the hymn was sent to Gregory
asaretum lor gists sent by him viz. a Cross and a Hymnary. The
Cross was reputed to be preserved at Tory Island in 1532, as O'Donnell
tells in his Ltse os Columba. Os the Hymnary we know nothing3 Todd
suggests that it may have been a copy of the br'ber Aute'ythouan‘us os
Gregory. The messengers sent to Gregory tested him by substituting
spurious stanzas lor the H, Ο, and U‘ stanzas os the hymn⁷; but
Gregory miraculously discovered their deceit. Gregory’s criticism that
there was more praise os the creature than os the Creator in the hymn
set Columba on the composition os the piece lu te Christe. See below
