TF] b{⁸lJi11ine the poet made this collect; or, it was Fiacc os
etty.

We commemorate Saint Patrick‚
chief apostle of lreland ;
Famous is his wonderful name,
ι flame that baptized heathenS.
5 He fought against druids

hard of heart ;
He cast down haughty rnen with the help os our Lord
os bright heaven ;
He cleansed Ireland's
10 territories, he the Great Birth.

We pray to Patrick, chief apostle‚
who hath saved us to Doom's day
From judgement by the malevolence
os dark demons.

15 God be with me, with the prayer
os Patrick, chief apostle!
