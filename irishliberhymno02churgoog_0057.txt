THE H mm NI CAR BRIGIT. liii

Stanza ix in monosyllabic rhyme consists ol a general
invocation to God which would be almost equally relevant any-
where else, although no doubt it is intended to describe the
“ prayer '’ ol l. 32.

Stanza x is an unintelligible verse, in which St. Kevin and
Glendalough are introduced without any justification. No doubt
the glossators have explanations to offer, but they are quite
inadequate. This and stanza xlvii sumish the only instances os
monosyllabic endings with alternate rhymes, 1 = 3 and 2: 4

At stanza xi we revert to the virtues ol the saint, in sequence
os ii-vi3 but stanza xii presents us with many problems. lts
metre has a strongly marked trochaic beat, as in the line,

edirm i crlala clrlns nach bi,

which shows a system ol ictus quite different from (say) stanza
v. But the metre ol it is undefinable, for it is uncertain which
ol the lines were intended to rhyme. Brzgti seems to have
been written 'thus with ti instead of te, to get a rhyme‚ but
whether with rl or bl it is impossible to say; and as dune is
(with just as much or as little reason) written duni in F, we have
the sour lines ending ri, Brrgti, duni (F), and bi in an unde-
terminable mixture. lt is with this curious stanza that the
Cogitosus series begins.

ln the next stanza (xiii) we have an absolutely different
order ol rhyme‚ viz„ dissyllabic in rst and 3rd lineS, trisyllabic
in 2nd and 4th. And the excellence ol these rhymes
sotllcd, lroegcd ; senamain, lenamain, is noteworthy; the poet who
made them could not have been guilty os stanza xii.

ln stanza xv we have crabdzg (F) = aumerle, and (possibly) ,
mad-boch! = a gart, the alternate lines rhyming.

Stanza xix. Here (l. 74) as at l. 45 we have the verbal form
dort'genai used as a quadrisyllable‚ whereas at ll 133, 161. we
lind the trisyllable dangre}

not appear.
