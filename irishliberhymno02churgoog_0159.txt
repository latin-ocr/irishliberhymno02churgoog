THE Η l'MN Ob ST. SECIINALI.. 99

not seem to be extant elsewhere ; but it is a distinctively Celtic hymn.
lt is possible that the gloss in Bon a. 52 ol the hymn Audite omnes
(p. 1ο), “ ut dicitur Christus, hostia et sacerdos ’³ may refer to a phrase
in it3 but this is quite itncertain.¹ Another English version is that oi
lt. F. hlacCarthy printed in Gaffney's Ancr'eut Irish Church.

B. 1. 120. Tlre Crunclr, ie. the mountain now called Croagh Patrick,
in Co. Mayo.

Hrstn or Sr. secanam.

'l‘his famous and ancient hymn in praise os St. Patrick has been
printed many times.

(n) Colgan printed it in his Trans Tlrauumturgu (1647), p. 211 from
F, with tolerable accuracy. He contented himself with giving only the
substance os the preface in a Latin translation.

(t) ll'are printed it at p. 146 01 his Opusculu S. patricii (1656) from
two MSS. one ol which seems to have been a copy ol F, ii not F itsels
(see his words, sol. i. p. xiv) ; the readings of the other do not agree with
any MS. known to us. He says oi it: “Est et aliud huius hymni
exemplar e quo licet manu recentiori exarato uariantes aliquas lection aa
ad marginem apponere uisum futt” (le. p. ¹50)· According to his
printed texta collation ol his principal MS. with T would give: 10
Petrum: 12 porta ,· 18 usura ; ²3 orn. et and dourr'num for de1; 31 sua
lor turm,- 34 reiteretur for irritentur (the reading ol his second MS.);
54qu1·andqutsquuu‚· 5 5 struuine for fulmine (the reading of his second
its.); 66 1114661117 67 taurii: 70 deitatem ,· 75 putreant and escaque ,-
76 celesti sallientur,- 81 elegit,· 84 stabuli obsolur't,· 8911e; 9² sanctes:
am. 1-6 at end And his secondary MS. had in addition to the above:
reetr‘rrlerm'portae aduersus eum uon preuaIebuut,· 76 sanatur,- 84 zabuli
absoluit. This MS. seems to be quoted by Ussher in his Religion os tlte
:ludent Irish ,· at any rate the readings ol verses 12 and 81 agree with
liis citations.²

(c) hluratori printed the hymn lrom A in his Auecdata Aeubrosr'aun
t 171 3) vol. iv. p. 136 ; this edition has non· been superseded by ll'arren's
,111117111111αζν uf Bangor.

(d) Todd printed it from T and B in his edition os the Liber &terrr-
orum (185 5), with notes and dissertations.

Secondary editions are numerous and need not be here mentioned 3
hut it may be noted that the Irish Prelace to the hymn in F was first
printed 11111111 in Whitley Stolres’ T rr'partite Lise af St. Patrick (1887 y,
pp. 242-6.

We have not been able to discover any independent its. authority·
lor the piece other than that ol the four manuscripts TFAB. T here is

.¹ Eg, in Ps Aug. Sem. clv. we haue: ‘¹ Hoc enirn hostia et sacerdos. The phrase occurs in
lrr-h (rs saeart ocis rs erlpairt) in a 11011111ν οη the Sacraments in the Leadlrar Breae, translated by
tl. Hogan in Todd uetares, tnta.. vol. vi. p. 22.
