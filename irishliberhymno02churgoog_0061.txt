THE LORICA OF ST. PATRICK. lvii

a Welsh predilection (cs. mys). In ii, the rhyme is not
perfect, for guasim is not a good rhyme to uasum, whatever
meaning is assigned to no·d·guasim. ln vi, antor os the third
line is a far better rhyme with galor than is calar. Stanza
ix seems anomalous; in it alone the harmony os the last
syllables in the last three lines of the quatrain is not observed,
l. 35 is short by a syllable, and the rhyme firma, thenga (F
thinga) in 1.36 is not very satisfactory, and lastly, we do not
really know the meaning of the words. ln stanza x (l. 40)
the rhyme ‘athachl is of itsels sufficient sor the corresponding
sctleraclr (l. 38),' and the particle ro seems to sorm a syllable
too many; probably ·roetlzaclt is to be read, which would
correspond with 'soetlzraclt ol F in l. 38.

The first two supplemental stanzas (xi and xii) do not
belong to the metre of the original poem, but are in setna·
mette, the formula of which is 2(ss -Ι- 7). ln xi we should
certainly read srutlzib in l. 41 and glan gel in 1. 42, with F.
The last stanza os all reverts to the heptasyllabic lines with

thyming dissyllables (2 = 4), and may possibly have belonged
to the original poem ; it also has the final harmonies im, ib, il.

Τὴε linguistic difficulties throughout make a reader wish
that the ‘ donation ' mentioned in the penultimate clause oi the
Prelace had not been tam cito,

Tlre Lon'ca os St. Patrick.

This piece is not in metm, but it is evidently constructed
with an eye to proportion, the phrase Atmanicg indiu which
recurs five times being followed by invocations of much the
same structure in each case, concluding with nine rhythmically
turned lines in invocation os Christ Perhaps the piece was
originally written in a particular shape‚ in imitation os some
form of material breastplate.
