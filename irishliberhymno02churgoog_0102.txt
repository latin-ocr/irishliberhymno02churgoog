ST. Bnoccaw’s Hanni.

Th] Victorious Brigid loved not the world ;
she sat the seat os John on a cliff,
she slept the sleep os a captive,—
the saint, sor the sake os her Son.

5 Not much os evil-speaking was got!
with losty saith (in) the Trinity
Brigid, mother os my high King,
of the kingdom of heaven best she was born.

She was not absent, she was not malicious,
10 she was not a mighty, quarrelsome, champion (Ρ),
she was not an addes striking, speckled ;
she sold not the Son os God sor gain!

She was not greedy os treasureS,
she gave, without poison, without abatement;
15 she was not hard, penurious,
she loved not the world's spending.

To guests she was not acrimoniouS,
to miserable weakiings she was gentle;
on a plain she was built (as) a city ;
20 may she protect us (in) hosts to the Kingdom.
