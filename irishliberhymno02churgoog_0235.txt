THE ΗΥΜΝ GENAIR PATRAIC. 175

The gloss on discipulis inl. 8, ie. apostolis, seems to confuse the
Thaddeus of the legend, who is said in Eusebius' account to have been
‘one of the Seventy,’ with Thaddaeus the Apostle (see above, p. 111).

lt may be observed that the extract from St. Augustine at the top of
fol 15 (see vol. i. p. 95) is read in the Roman Bretiary among the
lections for the Octave of All Saints. The connexion with the text is,
as usual, difficult to trace; it is possible that the word ‘custodis' with
which it opens may have some reference to the prayer, “Custodi nos
in bonis . . . ”with which the epistle is closed, but we cannot say that
we have any evidence by which to support this conjecture.

This important piece was first printed (from F) by Colgan in his
Tn'as (p. r),-with Latin translation and notes Passing by many

The second edition of Gatiielica, to whicli our references are made
throughout, appeared in 1872. In 1874 a complete photographic
reproduction of the piece from T was given in Gilbert's Nalianal
manuscripts os lreland, Part i (Plates xxxii-xxxv). And finally Dr.
Stokes printed the text of F afresh in 1887, adding for the first
time the marginalia which are so numerpus in that manuscript, and

important. Dr. Todd's edition of the Liber liymnorum was inter-
rupted by his death before the text of Piacc’s hymn was ready for
prelilse know of no manuscripts of the hymn worth collating save T
and F. There is a paper copy (saec. xix) in Egerton 154, and there
are at least two others in the Lihrary of the Royal Irish Academy

(17:²33 and ff-{Biz but they are of no independent value. Trans-

lations are numerous, but the only one, besides those of Stokes and
Colgan, to which reference need here be made is the metrioal rendering

of Sir Samuel Ferguson.⁶

A few words must he said as to the date and reputed author of the
hymn. The Irish Preface states that it was written by Fiacc, Bishop of
Sletty‚ who was a contemporary of St. Patrick. This F iace is men-
tioned iu the hlartyrologies of Oengus and Donegal at Oct. 12, and
his pedigree is traced in the Preface from Cuthair Mor, who was King
