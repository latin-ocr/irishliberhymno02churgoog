AMRA OF ST. COLUMBA. 61

T] God righteous, truly near, who hears my twin·waii
²05 from (his) heaven-land os clouds.

i.e. God TrueOne. Or, God os the righteous ; truly near,
quia est deas ubique et prope omnibus manantibus cum. My
tuin-wail, i.e. mytwo wailings, viz. wail os my body and wail of
my soul, aster clouds in heaven's land. Or, wail os Old
Testament and wail os New Testament. . . . to serve him
by men with every object.

NOt unworthy os song sor descendants os N eill.

i.e. not without tale Or, not trifling is the tale os Colum

Cille's death, to grandchildren of Neill, or to greatgmnd·
children of N eill.

They sigh not (as) single plains (but all together);
215 great woe, great noise intolerable.

ie not from one plain is it ‘alas’ or is it ‘groaning’sed
tons campis: the decease of Colum Cilleisa great woe; noise,
i.e. great is the trembling and the shaking that hath come into
Ireland at the decease of Colum Cille.

At the time when it tells os Colum being without lise,
without church.

πο ie the story is to us intolerable at the time when it is told
us os Colum's decease‚ of his being no more in the world or in
liie, of his no longer abiding in a church.

Ubi invenitur ‘ris ', i.e. ‘story’? Not hard 3 in the

Dialogue of the Two Sages, ut dicitur, “delight os a king,

smooth stories ”3 or in the Bretha Nemed, ut dicitur, “ not

payment oi a company (that tell) stories'’ ; i.e. he possesses

²²5 not the means oi delighting a company (ior their) stories

How would a sool speak os him?

ie ‘coi' is ‘way,’ in what way, and ‘india' is ‘will he
narrate’ 3 what then is the way in which a fool will tell os him?
Or, compared with him every person up to India was unleamed.
