aaa AMRA ort sr. cocunea, 23³

dixit Find U Baiscne &c” The verses on “Winter's Approach²² are
introduced to illustrate the use of raon, but are difficult to translate.
Dr. Sigersonl has given afree rendering which is worth citing, as he
has tried to keep the metre of the original:

‘⁸ List my lay: oxen roar3
Winter chides, Summefs 0'er,
Sinks the sun, cold winds rise,
Moans assail, ocean eries.

Fems flush red, change hides all,
Changing now, grey geese call,
Wild wings cringe‚ cold with rime,
Drear‚ most drear, icefrost time.''

Find, the descendant of Baiscne‚ is no less a personage than the giant
Finn hlac Cumhaill‚ who seems to have added the art of poetry to his
other accomplishments. According to the Four Masters he was alain
in 283 nr). But see below p. 236.

l. 419. Here verses 1¹4·1¹7 come in, as in LU andin ΥΒΙἡ

l. 451· The hospitality of the monastery of Iona is frequently men·
tioned by Adamnan. See Reeves' Adamana, p. 345 and ll 468. 574,
infra.

l. 4⁶3· We have here atradition‚ that Saturday‚ as well as Sunday‚

was obserwed at Iona as a festival. This is not hinted at by Adamnan ’

(see Vita Columbae iii. 12); but, as Mr. Warren has observed,² the
ranking of Saturday with Feasts of Martyrs in a rubric in the Bangor
Antiphonem, would suggesta similar practice. This would be inconsis-
tent with the practice of the Roman Church, but not with that of the
East and the majority of Western Churches in the time of Columba.i

[463. The first words of this line seem to relate to St. Columba's
woice; and they constituteadistinct fragment of the Amra in LU. See

l. 473. “The blind man ” is, of course, Dallan mac Forgaill‚ the
author of the Amra.

l. 474. The piece of the Amra contained in the leablrar Breac (Β)
begins at this point.

l. 476. This fragment is not intelligible to us.

l. 486. ln B and LU a new section begins here “De prudentia
eius et lectione et sapientia ”3 or, more correctly in YBL: “De
sapientia et pnrdentia illius‚'' for there is no mention of the saints
reading in what follows.

l. 489. Quia apud Finm'anum euangelrimr legit. It is probable that
this Finnian was St. Finnian of Mowille (d. 576); the statement of the
text is confirmed by the opening words of Adamnan's second book,
vin: ‘⁶ Alio in tempore, cum uir uenerandus in Scotia apud sanctum
Findbarrum episcopum, adhuc iuuenis sapientiam Sacrae Scripturae
addiscens commaneret, &c.'' See p. 14 5 supra.

l. 495. Reeves has drawn up in his Adamnan (pp. 276-298) a long
