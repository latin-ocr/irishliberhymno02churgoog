THE thtm 21st PROSATOR. 143

On f. 83 of ,ll we have thc end of the third book of the De m'ta
contemplatrira, thus: “Quando non res pro uerbis sed pro rebus enun-
tiandis uerba sunt instituta. Explicit liber tertius, Altus prosator, &c.”
the hymn then following without any verse divisions, and written as if it
were prose. At the end, after ordinibus, the next line begins “hic
insunt sub hoc corpore epigrammata beati Prosperi, &c.'‘

ln Ethc hymn is found in the same place as in hl between the De
uita contempl. and the epigrammata, and is written by the same hand
that has written the other pieces. ln the margin there was an eleventh
century note, which has been cut away by the binder so that only a few
letters remain. There were four lines of which the ends were: nus per
aI-,· t drge- ; pul-5 edit.

There is nothing to say about I, save that it is reported to be a
splendidly executed MS. and that the hymn is found in it among works
ascribed to St. Prosper. Itis followed by a collect of considerable
interest, on which we comment below (p. 168).

ΙΙ isa MS. of the eleventh century, the hymn following immediately
the Deuita contempl. The verses from l. 79 onward are written in a
hand of the fourteenth or fifteenth century, the old leaf having probably
become illegible through constant use.

Despite the witness of these manuscripts, however, we believe that the
hymn isa distinctively Celtic composition, and is not the work either of
St. Prosper of Aquitaine or of Julianus Pomerius. The genuine works
of Prosper arc quite different in character, both as regards form and
matter. The style of that writer has no resemblance to the rude and
barbarous, though vigorous, Latin of this hymn; and the speculations as
to the ermion and the fall of the ‘giants' are foreign to his ways of
thinking. And, although in the De uita contemplafr'ua (iii. 1) there is
a discussion of the fall of the angels, we cannot tind any good reason for
connecting the hyrnn with the name of Julianus Pomerius.

The lrish were fond of cosmogonic speculations; the first poem, ag.
in the &ltair na Rana, is devoted to them. And it is worth observing
bow akin are the topics treated in the hymn Altus Prosalor to those
discussed in the Bool( of Enoch, which widely affected mediaeval ways
of thinking.¹ Chapters lxxii-lxxxii of Enoch which deal with Celestial
Physics are not unlike the early stanzas of our hymn: the conceptions
of ‘the devil's satellites,’ of the lightning and the ninds issuing from
their secret chambers, of the beneficent influence of the rain, of the
stately and regular orbits of the sun and moon, have close parallels in
the Altus; while the Vision of Judgement at the eud of Enoch reminds
us of our nanzas RSTZ

The Latinity of the hymn, as we have said, is barbarous. lt presents
some resemblances to two other pieces which have Celtic connexionS,
via the [mica of Gildas (our No 48), and the curious tract entitled
Hispm'ca samr'na‚' which is written in a kind of assonant rhythm.
Zimmer has given an elaborate discussion³ of the date of these, and bas
