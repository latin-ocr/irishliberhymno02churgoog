53 Tassaclp ie. Patrick's artificem lu it is who first put a cover

This Tassach or Assicus was one os Patrick’s three artificers or
silversmiths,¹ the others being named Bite and Essu. Tassach is osten
mentioned in the TripartiteLtfe. The words os l. 54, “ Tassach's word
was not salse‚'’ were possibly introduced in allusion to a story that he
once, to his lasting shame‚ had told a lie ; but the phrase is common.²
His name is thus commemorated in the Felire ol Oengus at April 14:

‘⁴ The royal bishop Tassach
gave, when he came, the Body ol Christ,
the truly strong King,
at the communion to Patrick.''

This story ol his having given Patrick his last communion is also in
Muirchu's Memoir.³

Raholp is near Ballyculter to the northeast of Downpatrick.

The ‘long dny' spoken os in this line comes from Jos. x. 14 ε ‘non
tuit antea nec postea tarn longa dics) The verses which follow refer
directly to the battle os Beth-horon, where the sun stood still ‘ contra
Gabaonem.' The legend alluded to here is given more intelligibly
in the Tripartite Life (p. 2553 see also p. 487), where it is said that
‘an angelic radiance abode in Mag lnis till the end ol a year aster
Patrick's death' even as the sun went back ten degrees on the sundial
of Ahar, and as the sun stood still in the days oi Joshua. An earlier
account ‘de uigilis primae noctis iuxta corpus Patricii quas angeli
fecerunt' is found in Muirchu’s notes in the Boolr ol Annagh!
