BENEDICITE.

T his and the following hymn on the Magi are written on the blank
initial page (lol. r θ’.) oi F in a late hand, quite distinct srom the writing
os the body oi the book.

Neither piece has been printed before as the writing is hard to read;
but they do not seem to be os much importance.

We have not succeeded in identisying the work ascribed to S. Jerome,
on the “ Medicine oi the Soul” ; but, indeed, the whole piece seems
to be imaginative. There was no Pope oi the name ol Clement in
Jerome’s lisetime. The tone oi the fragment is very like that ol the
piece by Niceta, Bishop ol Remesiana, entitled De bono Psalmodr'ae.¹

There is a late paper copy oi this hymn on the Magi and the Star in

the Royal Irish Academy paper MS. classed (ἕξ-3 p. 3073 we have

not thought it worth while to append a collation.

The hymn does not seem to have been printed belore; it is, in
some places, difficolt to read, and we have been obliged to leave blank
spaces, as the text oi the Petit MS. does not always agree with that
oi F.

Lines 33-40 do not appear in the paper MS.; they are evidently oi
the nature os an appendix and did not belong to the original hymn
which ended at l. 32·

For this piece we have collated the manuscripts, A and Σ with F, as
they exhibit the same peculiar type ol text. The Latin texts oi
Benedicitc sall into two groups, via: (i) that oi Westem Breviaries
generally, the text ot the Vulgate (which corresponds with the true
LXX version). The reirain is laudate et superexaltate, &e This is the
text followed by onr English Book oi Common Prayer. (ii) The
text ot the O.L. version os Tbeodotion's Greek, lt the verses in (i) be
numbered consecutively r to 32, the text os (ii) may be thus repre-
sented: 1, 3, 2, 4-10, 15, 16, 11, the verse Benedr'cr'te pruina et m'ucs,
dte, 17-20, 22, 21, 23·3²· The reirain atter each verse here is

hymnum dr'cite et superexaltate, &e This is the text found in the
Westmr'm'ster Mr'ssal,² and, with an interchange oi place between verses
²7 and 26, in our Irish MSS. FAx. The repetition oi the reirain
ymnum dr'crle et superexaltate eum in semla suggests affinity (as Mr.
Warren has pointed out³y with Eastern usage, and the addition oi
domini in ll. 7, 9-29, in F and Σ (not in Α) is also a curious feature.
