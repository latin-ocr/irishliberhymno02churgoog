mum OF ST. OENGUS ,11Αο TIPRAITE. 135

Wexsord in the 13th century.¹ There was also a church in Dublin with
this dedication in the 1zthcentury; and before the Resonnation one ol
the 14 altars in St. Nicholas’ Church‚ Galway‚ bore his name.² lt is
possible that in sorne instances these place-names may preserve the
mernory ol another Martin, who was a disciple ol St. Patrick, but in the
majority ol cases it is probable that St lllartin ol Tours is alluded to.

ln l 15 ol the Prelace‚ the compound word gorraeberr'rmilr'u (cl. Hom-
Pass. 4²93) should be obserred. It is based on ι11111111111111111, an
imitation ol the word zpoaavroiqpr‘a = acceplri) personarum.

given in the Breiiary as the antiphon m pruno 1111111111 101 the tigils ol

known incidents rn the lile ol the saint

The indulgence mentioned at the end ol the Prelace: ‘⁴ that it would
be a protection against every disease‚ and heaven lor reciting it on lying
down and rising up‚'' would seem to point to the use ol the hymn asa
sort ol lorica or charrn. ll used in monastic offices, it would be at the
night or early morning hours.

The ‘tower Eder’ 'ml b'tm is mentioned twice in the Hebrew
Bible; in Gen. mv. 16 where the LXX has ὁ edomas· 1111111111 in
Micah iv. 8, where it has πύργος ποιμνίου ; the l'ulgate in both cases
being tum's gregis. The place meant in the former passage was near
Bethlehem, and St Jerome² identifies it with the scene ol the angelic
vision to the shepherds ; but the turris gregis nebulosa filiae Srbn
ol Micah was near Jerusalem. Bede (111 Le. ii. 8) is able to explain
the latter passage as prophetie ol the scenes at the Nativity hya slight
change ol reading (1111111111 lor uem'et); and it is to some such explan-
ation as this that we owe the statement ol the lrislr scholiasts that the
tower was “a mile east ol Jerusalem.’' It is worth adding that the
writer ol the Irish Homily on the Nativity in the [1111111111 Breac follows
the more correct geography and speaks ol the tower being a thousand
paces east ol Bethlehem.³

The reading Gabder ol the T Presace is a corruption ol gadder
(which, it will be remembered, is the name given to the tower by
the glossator on l. 14 os the 1111111111 S. Hilurir'); and this is a trans
literation ol the Lxx Γὰῖῳ, the representative os the Hebrew Ἢν.
