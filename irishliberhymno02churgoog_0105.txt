ST. BROCCAN'S H YMN.

TF] It was a miracle greater than others:
a morsel she requested ol the (kitchen·)solk
95 did not spoil the colour os her scapular
(though) it was flung, boiling, into her bosom

The leper begged a boon os her;
it was a good boon that besel him:
she blessed the choicest os the calves,
100 and the choicest os the cows loved it

He directed her chariot afterwards
northward to Bri Cobthaig Coil,
the call being with the leper in the car,
and the cow (following) behind the call.

105 The oxen‚ (when thieves) visited thern,
would have been pleased that anyone should hear them:
against thern rose up the river,
at morn they returned horne.

Her horse parted head from head-stall
110 when they ran down the slope ;
the yoke was not flung out os balance,
God's Son directed the royal hand.

A wild boar frequented her herd,
to the north he hunted the wild pig;

115 Brigid blessed him with her staff,
and he took up his stay with her swine.

Mugart, a lat pig sor her was given
beyond Mag Fea3 it was wonderful how
wild dogs hunted it lor her,
120 till it was (close to her) in Uachtar Gabra.

She gave the wild lox
on behall os her peasant‚ the wretched ;

to a wood it escaped
though the hosts hunted it.

125 She was open in her proceedings‚
she was One-Mother os the Great King's Son:

she blessed the liuttering bird
so that she played with it in her hand.
