AMRA OF ST. COLUMBA. 79

Τ] To him not the groan os one house; to him not the
groan os one string.

ie. ‘ong' means ‘visitation ’; or string (os) timpan harp;
or string (is) road. Not visitation os one house thereaster;
or not visitation os one string or oi one road, to us is the
bewaiiing of Colum Cille. Where is ‘ong' found? Not
hard: in the Fotha Breth, ut dicitur.

‘ongaib, coscaib carat’

i.e. with gruans, chastisements oi friends.

i.e. for fear of their chastisements os their visitation witha
view to the chastisement os him by his friends. Or, ‘ong’ is
‘ongan,' it was notan ‘ongan' os one house to him, but an
‘ongan’ of many houses. Or, it was notan ‘ongan' os one
road.

Heavy people, word under wave.

6 5 5 i.e. heavy is his bewailing with the tribes; and this story is
a word ‘under wave’

For it was due srorn him: the lamp os the king which
was extinguished, was relit.

i.e. the lamp os the iringof God; it was due to us (to
make) this eulogy on him. ‘do'radbad' i.e. ‘rodibad' is
ἑὶῖγῑζῑίηςυίεὴθά, in this world,’ was relit, yonder, r'n regno

660 Eulogy is this, ol' the king who made me king, who
will redeem usto Zion.

i.e. eulogy; ‘wonderful is the saying,' or ‘is the grace '3 or
‘not-smooth'; or ‘wonderful is the course that is under it
above! The ‘am' that is in it is the same as ‘death’qur'a
post mortem pretrirm laudis datum est caeco. Or, the ‘arn’ is
the sarne as ‘nem,' ‘heaven' so that ‘am-rath' means ‘nem-
rath' really, sor heaven was given him as the payrnent sor his
eulogy. ‘Oi the king who made me king,’ i.e. it was Colum
Cille that gave the bardship to me. ‘Zion’ i.e. perhaps,
'save us unto Mount Zion' or ‘to the heavenly city.’

May he carry me past torments.

i.e. may he take me past the demons os the air ad requam
⁶70 sanctorum. Or, past ‘riaga’ i.e. past the daughters os Orcus.
