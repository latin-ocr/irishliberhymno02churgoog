THE THREE IthGS.

Tne Turnus Koios.

Three Kings came to the house of God,
three faces like the bright moon,

from the Eastern learned world,

heavy . . . smooth, of slow streame

Three carne for the lovely child

t0 white flowered Bethel;

three, to whom was granted all knowledge;
three prophets of the vision.

Judgement of the great and glorious Lord
appeared to the . . . three;

in the vision to every crowd,

the Form of the King in the star.

A lofty star 3 it was beautiful

. . the wealthy world
he sees; it was a definite help
during the night of the firmament,

The three lucky Kings

followed it full readily;

the star went before thern

as an arch of blessing and might.

lt stopped not till it carne to the house
before the three right eagerlg

Τ he star, brilliant, round, sof ,

over every star swift walking.

ltishe . . . there
....... unsmooth
..... was on gallows

the king of the fourfold world.
