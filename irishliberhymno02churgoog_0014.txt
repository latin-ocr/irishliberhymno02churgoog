THE letm OF ST. HILARY.

C. unit-rhymes.

c, 6(8÷8) = ,‚ ‚, 14
d, n(8÷8) = „ ‚‚ 28.
We must now go through these in order.

Α. Unrlrymed Hyrrms.

Aa The unrhymed hymns may be considered first, as being
probably the least influenced by native tendencies Hyrnn
No. 7 (that ol St Hilary) is distinguished from all the rest by
the circumstance that it observes both quantity and clisrhn. it
is, in short, a regular trochaic tetrameter catalectic (quod apertis
Groecis ct Latinis frequentissime pontiur, according to the 1³
Prelace)‚ divided by a caesura alter the eighth syllable:

ymnum l dicat ζ ῐῢὼῖι j fristrirm,
ymnum l cintus Ι ρέτεὸξηὲῐ.

The rule set forth in the Presaccs that a spondee should not
occur in the third place is fairly adhered to; but the Presaccs
note its infraction in ll. 9, 24 (sec also 29, 34, 38, 60, 67). ln
other respects the quantity os the Latin vowels is observed (note
scandere crucem in 39) Also‚ elisim is regularly carried out, as
in 9. 1420¹ 23, 29, 322492211d 72‚73‚²74

Now this strict observance ol quantity and elision through·
out makes it highly probable that ll. 2 5, 26 are spurious:

uinum 1 quod delerat l idris motari a'quam iuJbet
nuptiis messro reltentis propinsnando {poculo

Here (a) deerat is impossible; (β) irrorari could not have
escaped elision; (y) idris should have been ydrir's (trisyll.), like
nuptiis in the following line; (δ) prdpinnando could not have
begun a trochaic measure; (ε) uilium has to be taken as
dependent on motari, ‘to be changed into wine‚' sor quod is
never used as = ‘because' bnt only as the neuter relativc3
