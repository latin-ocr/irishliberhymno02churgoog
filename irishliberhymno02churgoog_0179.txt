THE Hl'MN SEN DE. 11

18 danjarslaice] le. may lte release us T F.

The notes on the nameus Ignatius in T and F are much delaced3
enough remains to show that they recorded the story of his martyrdom.
The note in T seems to have been substantially the same as a note at
Dec. 20 in a copy os the Felire of Oengus now in the Franciscan
Library‚ Dublin, written by one Ruaidhri O’Liunin, viz. “Episcopus
sed post Petrum episcopatum tenuit, sed sub Traiano imperatore passus
est Ignatius et leonibus datus est et aliis bestiis.'’¹ No doubt it comes
from some martyrology.

19 dt'tlrrubaclr] ae. prodeo alsa F.

22 anaclet] i.e. tlte king ruha prolecled T F.

luchllaclr] ia. lu's people as lake ; ar, ln's black peaple ,· le. Nae cum suls
trr'busfilris el quatuor uxores earum T. The glossis hardly intelligible ;
it seems to employ an alternative meaning os loch, viz. lala or blak, as
an etym. explanation os luclrtlacla ‘erew '(?). Perhaps luchllaclr rs not
the right word, sor as the line stands it cannot be construed. Some-
thing like ‘the King who saved Noah from destruclian’is what we
should expect. The gloss in F is illegible sor the most part3 but it was
probably the same as in T.

²3 rex Salem] The note in the margin of F is almost illegible3 what
is lest yields il is lla apinran as llic Hebraeis lla! lie aras (stite) genealogia
(st'cut) angelus.

Salem] . . . ll is noarever llre opimari astla Hebraeus llral llu's is
tlte same as Jerusalem ; aad further u is the aptalon (af alliers llral ll was
on tlte banks) af llu reuersordan, and in it druell illelclu'aalck Fu.

References sor the Jewish tradition, alluded to in the passage from
Jerome cited in the T gloss, that hlelchizedek was identical with Shem,
are given in Baring Gould’s Legends af 0.Τ, Charactcrs (vol. i. p. 139,
and vol. ii. . 1.

incerto aientia] Compare Hebr. vii. 3.

25 Soter] tle. σωτὴρ. The occasional introduction ol some familiar
Greek word is a well-known practice os Irish writers, The glossator in T
apparently thought that it wasa Hebrew word!

sacras] tle. He freed T F.

Loth] tie. declrnans interpretatur, i.e. bal, san as Haran, sau af Teralr,
frater Sarra T F.

²7 Ur] The legend given in the passage from Jerome cited in the
margin ol T was very popular in the East.² It is incorporated into the
Koran (xxi. 5²-7 5) 3 and Abraham’s escape lrom the surnace ol Nimrod
was celebrated in the Syrian Church on Jan. ²5· There is a trace os it
even in the Vulgate; in Neh. [2 Esdr] iv. 7 we read Tu ipse domine
deus qur‘elegrslt' Abram el edua-tili eum de igne Chaldaeorum. T he legend
is probably based on the fact that aa& = ‘light' or ‘lire'

Galdai] tlte Chaldees tie. Caldei dlcli quasi Casdi. rie. fram Cased san
os Nalm san af Teralr &a Fet. See Gen. xxii. 22. The etymology is,
