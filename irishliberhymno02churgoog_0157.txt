F. l. ¹3· secundum ordinent asphobett'.]-That is, rnore' Hebraeorum, as
the Bprelace explains The instancesos the alphabetical Psalms and os
the lamentations will at once occur to the reader. The Celtic hymn
writers were much inclined to this device: uo less than five pieces in
the Liber Hynrnmnrn, viz. Nos. 1, 2, 14, 25, and 28 are alphabetical,
and there are other instantes in the Arrtr'plronnry ry‘ Bnngor. 'l'wo
t'ragrnentary alphabetical hymns attributed to St. Hilary os Poitiers are
found in an eleventh century its. of Hilary De Absterret} A hymn os
this sort (in nearly the same melre, see p. xiii above), on the Day ol
‘ludgement “Apparebit repentina dies magna domini‚'' is given by
'l'rench in his Sacred Latin Pirelry (p. 290) 3 another is printed by
l)iimmler (in allon. Germ. Hr'st. i. 79) beginning “Ad perennis uitae
sontem et amoena pascua.’' And Berle has one in his Errl. Hr'st.
(iv. 18). See also the examples cited by hir. Warren (Antiplmnaryry
Bangon ii. 51, 52.)

this points to a daily use os the hymn in the monastic offices: it does
not seem to us that there is sufficient evidence lor this. That special
indulgentes were attached to its recitation was, however. an old belief.
ln the seventh century part of the Book of Arrnnglr (a composite book
written in the year 807 by one Ferdomnacrr), the second of the four
petitions granted to Patrick by the angel Victor was ‘⁴ ut quicumque
ymnum qui de te compossitos est, in die exitus de corpore cantauerit‚
tu iudicabis poenitentiam eius de suis peccatis”³ Again in the same
hook (iol. πό) there is another passage referring to the use ol the hymn
which is sufficiently important to be cited in tull. ‘⁴ Patricius sanctus
episcopushonorem quaternum omnibus monasteriis et aeclessiis per
totam Hiberniam debet habere, idest,
