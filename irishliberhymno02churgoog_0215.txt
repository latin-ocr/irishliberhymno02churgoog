'l'he day of the Lord, the King of Kings most righteous, is at
hand ι
a day of arath and vengeance‚ of darkness and cloud ;
roo a day of wondrous mighty thunderings‚
a day of trouble also, of grief and sadness,
in which shall cease the love and desire of women
and the strife of men and the lust of this world.

Trembling we shall be standing before the judgement seat of the
Lord,
105 and shall give account of all our deeds;
seeing also our crimes set before our eyes,
and the books of conscience open before us,
we shall break forth into most bitter cries aud sobs,
the necessary opportunities of action being withdrawn.

tro As the wondrous trumpet of the First Archangel soundeth,
the strongest vaults and sepulchres shall burst open,
thaning the (death) chill of the uren of the present world ;
the bones from every quarter gatheriug together to their joiuts,
the ethereal souls meeting them

11 5 and again returning to their proper dwellings

Orion wanders frorn his culmination the meridian of heaven,

the PleiadeS, brightest of constellations, being left behind,

through the bounds of Ocean, of its unknown eastern circuit;

Vesper circling in lixed orbits returns by her ancient paths‚
rao rising after two years at eventide;

(these), with figurative meanings, (are) regarded as types.

ll'hen Christ, the most High Lord, descendeth from heaven,
before Him shall shine the most brilliant sign and standard of the
Cross;
and the two chief luminaries being darkened,
12 5 the stars shall fall to the earth, as the fruit from a figtree,
and the surface of the world shall be like a fiery furnace.
Then shall the hosts hide themselves in the caves of the mountains.

By chanting of hymns continually ringing out,
by thousands of angels rejoicing in holy dances,
¹30 and by the four living creatures full of eyes,
with the four and twenty happy elders‚
casting down their crowns beneath the feet of the lamb of Gon,
the Trinity is praised with eternal threefold repetition.

T he raging fury of lire shall consume the adversaries,

r 35 unwilling to believe that Christ came from Gon the Father;
but we shall forthwith fly up to meet Him,
and so shall we be with Him in divers orders of dignities
according to the everlasting merits of our rewards,
to abide in glory, for ever and ever.

ll’ho can please (ἔοι) in the last time,
when the glorious ordinances of truth are changed?
Who but the despisers of this present world?
