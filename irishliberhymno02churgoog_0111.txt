the protection os himself and his monks against the deadly
enemies that lay in ambush sor the clerics. And it is a
lorica oi saith sor the protection of body and soul against
demons and men and vices: when any person shall rccite
it daily with pious meditation on God, demons shall not
dare to sace him, it shall be a protection to him against all
poison and envy, it shall be a guard to him against sudden
death, it shall be a lorica sor his soul after his decease.

Patrick sang it when the ambuscades were laid sor him by
Loegaire, in order that he should not go to Tara to sow the
Faith‚ so that on that occasion they were seen before those
who were lying in ambush as is they were wild deer having
behind them a iawn, viz. Benen; and ‘Deer's Cry' is its
name
