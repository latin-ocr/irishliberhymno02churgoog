with its vague conlrualai in l. 65, its clision in the case of adclhr,
its reference to “the other Patrick’' (where did the visit take
placen, lead me to inler here also interpolation, in spite ol
the rhyme in this case being the normal dissyllabic. This
last stanza is the more probably genuine that it does not
attempt to establish itsell as such by the repetition ol all the
hals line.

Admitting, as l do without reserve‚ the uncertainty ol suh
jective criticism, l have not deemed it right to pass by in silence
the objections that are to be urged against the genuineness os
the poem in the sorm in which we have it. Many ol these
objections would be still valid, even though the metrical system
was uniform throughout; but the presence ol the metrical vari-
ations seems to me to suggest strongly the relatively late
‘compilation' ol the poem; the neglect which it exhibits ol
poetical and metrical considerations can only be attributed to a
period ol decline and decay.

Nim'nds Praycr.

The Oratio Nininr' (our No, 20), shows no appearance ol a
regularly constructed poem, though there seems to have been
an initial eisort in that direction‚ lor the first lines present the
formula 2 (7 ÷ 5); but all throughout there is a rhythmic
tendency that is unmistakeable. lt may be mere accident,

but it is at all events noteworthy that an alphabetic order is .

observed in the lines t—airdirc, ores, cathaigestar, dedaig‚
sonenaig‚ guidmit3 and that all throughout also the alliterative
clement is strongly marked, as in these words in order :-a p p ‚
aaabb; cddcdd; ssls;gg; pp; bb; ddd;
p p. But it adds nothing definite to our knowledge ol the
metric system.
