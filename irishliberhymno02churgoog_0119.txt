AMRA OF ST. COLUMBA.

hid not ‘ceis' music from Craiptine's harp,
that brought a death-sleep on hosts ;

it joined harmony between Maen

and marriageable Moriath of Morca.
Iabraid was more to her than every prize.

Sweeter than every song was the harp

that was played (to) Iabraid Loingsech Lorcc3
though the king was silent and plunged in secrecy,
Craiptine’s (harp) hid not ‘ceis'

Three years was he without light,
Colum, in his Black Church3

he went to angels out of his captivity
aster seventy-six years.

‘so' is a name sor ‘ good' and for ‘honour'3
‘fi' is a name for ‘evil ’ and sor ‘disobedience ’ 3
‘an' is ‘true,'-and it is no weak knowledge,-
‘iath' is ‘diadem' and ‘iath' is ‘land’

‘mur' means ‘multitude' yonder in the law,
‘coph,' ‘victory‚'-it is a full-right word.-
‘du‚’ ‘place‚' ‘du' means ‘thy right‚'

‘cail‚' ‘protection' and ‘cul' ‘chariot’

Ethne preeminent in her lisetime

the queen os the Carburys

the mother of Colum,-bn‘ght perfection-,
daughter os Dimma mac Noe.

Up to the distance of a mile and a half vas clear the voice of
90 Colum Cille in saying his offices‚ ut dicit poeta:
The sound of Colum Cille's voice,
great its sweetness above every company3
up to fifteen hundred paces,
vrith wonders os courses, is the distance that it was clear.

Hi with the multitude os its relics

os which Colum vas dear sosterchild;
he went out of it at last,

so that Down is his old sanctuary.
