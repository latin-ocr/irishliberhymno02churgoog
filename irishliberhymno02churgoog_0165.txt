THE Hl'rllrl' OF ST. s‘Ec'HnttLt. 105

87 qaam] viz. a great tuing, aaran balterus legem sacri nominis qrrod est
Trinitas T B.

88, 89 There is a precision os doctrinal statement here, which
indicates at least that the Christological controversies of the fourth and
trith centuries leit their mark on the language os Celtic Christendom.

89 praediatus] rie. gir! round B.

90 sine intermissione] Augustinus dicit, Siquis in rrrraquoqae liora certa
tempora orandi absentat, sine intermissione orat ,· ia. celebratior of eoclr
canonr'col haur T.

A similar interpretation of St. Paul’s precept is found in the Irish
writer Sedulius (in Ep. ad Rornanos ed. hligne col. 16). “Aut ergo
dicendum est eum semper orare et non deficere. qui canonicis orationi-
hus quotidie iuxta ritum ecclesiasticae traditionis, psalmodiis precibusque
consuetis Dominum laudare et rogare non desistit. Et hoc estquod
Psalmista dicebat, Benedicam Dominum ia omnitempore, semper laus
rias r'n ore meo (Ps. xxviii. 2).''

This is rejected, however, hythe writer of the ll'iirzburg Glosses‚
already referred to. He notes (ed. Stokes, p. 315) “ ll'hat may be the
prayer without ceasing? Not hard. Dicunt alii that it is celebratiou
os the canonical hour quod non est uerum &c.” lt is also reJected in
the Benedictine Rule,¹ which observes : ‘⁶ nobis uero non expedit caeteris
horis ab oratione uacare’'

9² cum apostolis regnabit saraias saper Israel. 'l'he gloss in B gives
the legend which grew out os this verse in later years, viz. regnabit
Patricius saper Scotos in dr'e iudicii. We also find it in l'iacc’s hymn v.
52· “Around thee in the day of the Judgement, the men of lreland
will go to Doom.'' ln hluirchu hlaccu hlactheni’s notes in the Book
os Armagh, the priario petitio which the Angel granted to Patrick is
“ut Hibemenses omnes in die iudicii a te iudicentur.’'“² The legend
indeed became very widespread, and reappears in many places ; eg. in
the Second Vision oi Adamnan³ at §6 we have: ‘⁴ lt is Patrick who
will be their judgeand their advocate on Doomsday.'' So in the Secreta
in the Corpus and Rosslyn hlissals⁸ we find an allusion to the same
belief: “ Hostias tibi quas in honore sancti Patricii offerimus deuotus
accipias, ut nos a timore iudicii liberemur.'’

93 Audiit ariarathe opening words ol the hymn, are added at the
close according to the regular lrish practice oi which many examples
will meet us as we proceed. lllone (lismoi Latini taedii uerri iii. 242)
remarks that this custom is sometimes adopted by German hymn
writers. lt was probably invented sor the purpose ot clearly marking.
tlte point at which one piece ended and another began, not always
obvious oi itseli in manuscripts written closely and continuously witha
view to the economising oi parchment. Mone adds that there seems
to have been a special tendency among lrish hymn writers to begin
their hymns with the word ‘Audite’
