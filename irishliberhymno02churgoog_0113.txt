Τ] Ι invoke therefore all these forces to intervene between me
and every fierce merciless force that may come upon
my body and my soul:

against incantations os salse prophets
against black laws of paganism

against salse laws of heresy

against deceit of idolatry

against spells os women and smiths and druids

against all knowledge that is sorbidden the human soul.

55 Christ for my guardianship t0·day

against poison, against buming,
against drowning, against wounding,
that there may come to me a multitude os rewards;
Christ with me, Christ before me, ·
60 Christ behind me, Christ in me,
Christ under me, Christ over me,
Christ to right os me, Christ to left of me,
Christ in lying down, Christ in sitting. Christ in rising up
Christ ln the heart os every person, who may think of me!
65 Christ in the mouth os every one, who mav speak to me!
Christ in every eye, which may look 0n me!
Christ in every ear, which may hear mei
