ST. BROCCAN'S H ΥΜΝ.

TF] When she‚—it was a danger for her,-

her Son before her failed her not (?):
he put raiment in the basket
of Roncend in a chariot of two wheels

The mead·vat that was brought fo her ;
170 whoever brought it was not unrewarded (?);
for there was found (honey) in a wall of the house:
it had not been found there up to that!

She gave for behoof of her servant
when he stood in need ;
175 not merely was no surplus found there,
but not a drop was wanting.

Upon us may Brigid’s prayers rest!
and she against danger be our aid!
may they be on the side of her weaklings
180 before going into the presence of the Holy Spirit!

May she aid us with a sword of fire
in the fight against black swarms!
may her holy prayers protect us
past pains, into the kingdom of Heaven !

185 Before going with angels to the battle
let us reach the chureh with a run!
commemoration of the Lord is better than any poem:
Victorious Brigid loved not the world.
Brigid loved not

l beseech the patronage of St. Brigid
190 with the saints of Kildare;
may they be between me and pain!
may my soul not be lost!

The nun that drove over the Curragh,
may she be a shield against edges os sharpness!
195 l have not found her like, save Mary:
we honour my Brigid.
