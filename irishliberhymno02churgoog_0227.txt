THE HYMN ALTUS PROSATOR. 167

Jerome on Mt xxiv. 30, and Cyril Hieros. Cat. xv. 22. The idea,
indeed, lsas oldas the Didaclte (1111. 6);ἐνκα medardum vryo marr ἁσνρμεῖα
ν1ν aldulfi ννεὶῐνννιν εἐνννν ννεῑοννν othim
νάπιλ wamy ὸτίτννρ νάστιι 1111 νεκῶνρ. The thud line 01 the Dus
Irae, according to the later Gallican version, is “crucis expandens
uexilla'’ And the hymn Vexilla regis is followed rn the Roman
Breviary‚ on Sept. 14, by the versicle and response: “Hoc signum
crucis erit in caelo: cum dominus ad iudicandum uenerit.''

134 Zelus ignis fiaeribundus. This phrase may possibly point to a
version 01 Hebr. x. 27 different from that 01 Jerome, which is quoted in
the title.

135 This line would seem to point to a period and locality where
the Divinity 01 0111 Lord had been questioned: this would hardly be
Gaul in the seventh or eighth century, but it might very well be
Scotlaud or Ireland in the sixth, where Christian preachers had sre-
