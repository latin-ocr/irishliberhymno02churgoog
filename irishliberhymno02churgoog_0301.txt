THE Halm CHRISTI PATRIS IN Marma. 241

It needs not to be added that Magnificat, associated in the notes
cited from B with Benedicftc, Canta quitata, and Gloria fn Excelsr's,

pas psat}1 at {espers in the West, and was appointed for Lauds in the
‚ree urc .

Tua Hruw Cnarsaa ow ιω( Er.

The tradition of the Irish Preface that this well-known hymn was
composed by Ambrose is a venerable one, as Hincmar in the year 857
distinctly names him as the author.¹ But his Benedictine editors refuse
to allow the hymn to be by Ambrose, and Mone (Irfymni audii aaut} i.
p. 92) holds that it cannot be older than the seventh century. It exists
in countless manuscripts, and was in use in many parts of Europe as
a Compline hymn so early as the ninth century.² There is nothing
specifically Celtic about it, and it is not worth while to collate the
texts

Mone prints ll. 3, 4, thns :-

Lucifer lucem proferens

uitam beatam tribue.
He points out that the application ol the title lucifer to Christ is a
mark of antiquity; He is πηγὴ φωσφόρος.

The hymn has been translated into English a dozen times (see Julian’s
Dici. osHymnology, p. 2²7), and is one of the most familiar hymns in
use at Evensong in our churches.

Tru: Hruu Carasa! astruas m narrans.

We have found this hymn nowhere save in F, where it follows the
Gloria in excelsis. It has been recently printed by Dreves in his
Analecta fflmni medii aeui, xix. 2363 following him, we have entitled
it “De SS. Petro et Paulo.” The rhyming system on which it is con-
structed is Celtic (see p. xxiii), and it is very probably a native hymn of
the Irish Church. The monastery in which the manuscript F was
written may have been dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul, such a
dedication being common in Ireland as in Englaud. Thus the great
abltey church of Glendalough was “SS. Petri et Pauli '’; there was
a monastery with the same dedication at Annagh³; and on Saint's
lsland in Lough Derg the Augustinian priory of St. Peter and St. Paul
was on the site of an old foundation. Another abbey of the same
name was founded by St. Tighemach, afterwards Bishop of Clones‚ in
the sixth century.

ll. 21, 22. “talenta euangelica sancta uon sine ussura'' recall the
words used of St. Patriclr in the hymn of St. Sechnall (ll. 17, 18):
‘· Electa Christi talenta uendit euangelica quae Hibernas inter gentes
anm usuris exigit.”

In l. 30 bradiirm is evidently a blunder for brabtiam = βραβεὼν. See

l'hil. iii. 14 “ad brauiam supernae uocatae‘omt Dei.''
