THE Hl'MN IN TE CHRISTE. 169

hBhfol. 237³ marg] This note gives a direction for the recitation of
t mn:
e y ‘⁶ Recite to seven times the Altus

which gives no ‘law’ to hard demon ;

there is no disease in the world,

nor shower that it will not drive uacat

B fol. 238b marg] The connexion of this note with the hymn is not
very plain ; possibly it has reference to the fall of Satan through pride,
sung of io stamas C H &cz

“There is a triad
that is not allowed to the poor of the living God:
thanklessness with his life, whatever it hc,
grumbling, and pride.”

‘The poor of the living God’ suggests St. hlatth. v. 13 Dr. Lawlor
observes that this may perhaps indicate a connexion of this metrica}
note with the Altus through the pedt'lauimn (see p. 168 supra).

With the form of the verse we may compare another marginal note in
B (fol. yrl: “Three things there are through which God’s pleasure is
amineo, viz. : chastity in youth, austerity in middle life, sadness in old
agell

On fol. 6 of F there are written in the margins in a sixteenth century
hand a few lines of a metrical martyrology for February and March,
together with one or two other Latin scraps. They are hard to read,
and do not seem worth reproducing here.

The lrish Prefaces need no comment, they refer to the tradition
found in the Prefaces to the Altus (see above, p. 25), that Columba
composed the hymn Inte Christe in consequence of the criticism made
by Gregory upon the scanty praise of the Creator in the former hymn.
As was observed above (p. 141) the hymn entitled Aaiutor laborantium
in the T Preface to the Altus may possibly be the one now before us.

We know of no copies of the ln tc Clrrtste save those contained in the
tvo manuscripts (T and Fi of the liberHymnoram. lt was first printed
by Colgan (T rias, p. 47 5) from F. A metrical translation by Rev. A.
Mitchell appeared in the &otttslz Stondard Bearcr for June, 1897.
Mt. lllacgregor has printed another in his St. Columbo.

The hymn naturally falls into two parts, the verse ‘Christus Redemp
tor’ (1. 17) beginning the second division. And the statement of the T
scholiast that some held that Columba only coniposed the live lines 17-

21 is very interesting. 'she fact is that the hymn is made up of a large
number of liturgical phrases, many of which appear elsewhere; and there
is nothing iu either matter or Latinity in the least like the poem Altus
prosator in the case of which we have found good reason sor accepting
the Columban authorship.
