48 ST. SANCTANS Hl'MN.

TF] May mercy come to me (on) earth,
from Christ let not (my) songs be hiddenl
let not death in its death-wail reach me,
nor sudden death in disease befal me!

2 5 May no malignant thrust that stupefies and perplexes
reach me without permission ol the Son os God!
May Christ save us [τοττι every bloody death,
[τοττι tire, irom raging sea!

From every death-drink, that is unsale
30 [οτ my body, with many terrorsl
may the Lord each hour come to me
against wind, against swilt watersl

1 shall utter the praises os Mary’s Son
who fights ior good deeds‚
35 (and) God ο[ the elements will reply.
(ior) my tongue (is) a lorica [οτ battle.

ln beseeching God from the heavens
may my body be incessantly laborious;
that l may not corneto horrible hell

40 I beseech the King whom 1 have besought.
¹ l beseech a wonderful King.

Bishop Sanctan . . . asage
soldier, angel famous pure-white,
may he make sree my body on earth,
45 may he make holy my soul towards heaven!

May there be a prayer with thee forme, O Mary!
May heaven's King be mercilul to us
against wound, danger and peril!
O Christ, on Thy protection (rest) we!

50 I beseech the King sree, everlasting
Only Son of God, to watch over us ;

may He protect me against sharp dangers,
He, the Child that was born in Bethlehem.
