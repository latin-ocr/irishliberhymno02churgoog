meant.

ει harodi caminus] ile. a mark osdefim'tthn on latia (as compared) trulla
tlte first santes. Another explanation of conanus is suggested in the
neat gloss, wia, Chrtsto. The construction is obscure3 probably we
should understand prece before alternas and translate: ‘⁴ let us ask the
prayer of James to be near to us aided by the prayer of the other
lanies?
⁵ 22 subacti] tle. later Ire came to Christ picam pradictus, arrd fqut· atara

It is not clear whether we should read sami (Todd) or suiad (Stokes).
Possibly o suad should be read for the pl. luarcain o fiatad is common
enough; and rogabant i na cheud di means ‘they struck him on the
head nith it' (Hom-[lass. 3299).

²3 Τ he gloss on Tafher' confuses (ιβ Jerome ia Manli. x. 4) the
Thaddaeus of the Abgar legend, whom Eusebius (H. E. i, 13) describes
as ‘one of the Seventy' with 'l'haddaeus the apostle; a blunder which
we shall meet with again in a gloss on the letter of Christ to Abgar.
See. on the whole subJect‚ p. 173 infra, and the references there given.

tellam] de. over tlte atraers of tlte earth, sor flia! indeed is tlte attav in
anhalt lie terties, cl sic scribitur recle per tellum tle. rura. Talmamtaib is
from the adj. falmanda ‘terrestrial' (Hom-llus. 5857, 5878, 589 5) ; and
m'llib means ‘angles‚,corners,' as in Hom-Pasa. 37²8· Cf. Apoc. vii. ι.
‘super quatuor angulos terrae!

aa cpt'sfafa] The words ‘Beatus es' in the gloss are the opening
words of the reputed letter of our Saviour to Abgar‚ King of Edessa.
which is found in our collection (No. 18); see the notes upon it below.
The legend that its bearer was one ‘Ananias cursor' is as old as
Eusebius (HE. i. 13), to the latin translation of whose history by
Rufinus there is no doubt a reference at the end of the gloss: “ ut
historia ecclesiastica narrat.'’

25 suapte] t'n sua aegaeae ael sua ctitr'fafe, arada allata is extra herc,

been curiously misread by former editors.

The end of the gloss shows that the F variant, acta for septem. was
current in the time of the glossator, and that there was some doubt as·
to which was the true reading. lt is plain that the difference between
,uii and ,uiii is very slight. and that a confusion might easily arise.
