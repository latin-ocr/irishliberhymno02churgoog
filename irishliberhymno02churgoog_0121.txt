AMRA OF ST. COLUMBA.

Τ] Bngitadixit: ·

140 Good I deem my smallness ;
to earth descends each race,
though any one were placed somewhat lower,
the love ol Jesus he would merit there.

Τὴε Amra ol Colum-every day
145 whoever he be that recites 'it in its entirety,

An assembly Ι gathered-it is great lolly,

in the house over Datim-lias,
r 50 O my Lord,O King ol noble mysteries
in which there is ........

There is a woman in the country,
her name is not said:
ex ea erumpit peditum
155 like stone out os sling.

It is a physician's medicinechest without an alebag,
it is asking ol marrow without bone,

it is a strain oi music on a harp without a ‘ceis,'-
so is our state in the absence os our noble orgau.

160 May thy bed be in swistness!
aiter thy light, sail oi long height,
may there be brought in a chariot alter a horse
thy wile, Ο hero, to her sair church!

Ferchertne the poet dixit .·
16 5 Is name oi demon shouted to you?
he who announces pain sor his household :
may God not leave me, East or West,
in the track ol the demon on whom it is shouted.

‘Cul' is a name sor a chariot without fault,
170 in which I used to go with Conor ;
and ‘neit’ was a name sor the battle
which I used to fight along with Cathbath’s son.

Woe with my looking to him l
increases on wall glauce from below;
17 5 it was sweeter they sang a drouemunnur
his two bags towards a glance from below.
