TF] Martine. Oengus mac Tipraite, pricst os Cluain Fota
Baitan Aba, composed leutrc hymnum. In Cluar'n Fotasactus
est. Causa autem : Adamnan was on circuit os the churches
os Colum Cille in lreland, and he got as far as Uisnech
in Meath, where there was summoned to him every manin
orders against whom there was an accusation in the land;
and the summons reached Oengus on the night of Martin's
feast, et timuit ualde ut fecit lrunc hymnum in lwnorem Martini
to free himself. Ueni! then Oengus to the tryst on the

' morrow, with his hymn ready by him, and there was shown
to Adamnan, Martin on the right hand of Oengus; so then
Adamnan rose up before him, et hononficauit eum min osculo,
ct ornnes mirabantur causam lionoris ,· et dt'stit Adamnan ut
rct'clit Martinam securri, so that it is on account of Martin’s
being along with him that hc paid him honour. Thus then
Oengus was freed; et ostendit hymnum suum et laudauit
Adamnan hymnum, et dixit, “personal reverence (shall be)
sor him who recites it on going to meeting or court,‘’ and that

it would be a protection against every disease; and heaven
l'or reciting it on lying down and on rising up.

lines in each; correspondences also there are in it, ct non
(cqzrnlcrn nrmrerum syllabarum singuloe linere seruant.
