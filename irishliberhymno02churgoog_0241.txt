THE H l'rlIrV GEMfIR PATRAIC. 181

The country of the ‘⁴ Fortuatha '’ or “ stranger tribes '' of Leinster‚ where
he is said to have landed‚ was the district round Glendalough in the co.
Wiclrlow. Here, according to the story, he found two or three churches,
but produced no lasting impression ; and, leaving, he was driven by
storm round the north coast of Scotland until he found himself at For-
dunin Kincardineshire.

We then have an account of the mission of Patriclr by Pope

Celestine, about which controversy has run so high. This is not the
place to discussit fully. A good account of the materials will be found
in Todd’s St. Patrick, p. 3²¹ ff.

The “Staff of Jesus'' was long counted one of the most precious
possessions of the Seeof Armagh3 it was removed in AngloNorman
times to Christ Church Cathedral at Dublin, where it was destroyed by
Archbishop Browne with other relies of antiquity at the Refonnation.¹

These celebrated verses were held to have been the composition of
the pagan Druids, and to have been a prophecy of the introduction of
Christianity into lreland. We first meet with a mention of thern in the
seventh century notes by Muirchu Maccu Mactheni preserved in the
Book of Armagh. “Haec autem sunt uersiculi uerba, pro linguae
idiomo non iarn manifesta:

‘Adueniet asciciput³

curn suo ligno curuicipite

et sua domu capite perforato.
